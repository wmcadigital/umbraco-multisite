<li><em>Full speed ahead: bringing high speed rail to the East Midlands</em> report launched today</li>
<li>Derby event brings together business and political leaders</li>
<li>Massive economic benefit to region to deliver high-speed rail</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At an event today (3<sup>rd</sup> July) the region's business and political leaders will come together in Derby to launch </strong><em><strong>Full speed ahead: bringing high speed rail to the East Midlands</strong></em><strong> report which lays out the ‘overwhelming’ case to deliver high-speed rail to the East Midlands.</strong></p>
<p>HS2 and Rail Minister Huw Merriman MP will be making a keynote speech and joined by business chiefs and senior politicians including Sir Peter Soulsby, Cllr Ben Bradley MP and Amanda Solloway MP.</p>
<p>The report outlines the benefits of bringing HS2 to the East Midlands and Sheffield as proposed in the Government’s Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands (IRP). The arrival of HS2 in the East Midlands, integrated with other projects such as Midlands Rail Hub and Midland Main Line electrification will bring cities and towns in the East Midlands closer to each other and to centres such as London and Birmingham.</p>
<p>When HS2 is delivered in full, the number of people within a 90-minute rail journey of Derby will increase by more than 500,000; an additional 600,000 people will be within 90 minutes of Chesterfield.</p>
<p>This agglomeration will lead to an increase in job opportunities for East Midlands residents and more trade for local businesses. Nottingham, Derby and Chesterfield can currently access an economy of around £250 million within 90 mins by rail. With HS2 in place this figure will increase to over £550 million.</p>
<p>Analysis in the report shows that HS2 will nearly double the number of jobs in high value, rail-linked sectors within an hour of Nottingham by rail, and nearly quadruple the number of jobs within two hours.</p>
<p>In total, journeys from 74 stations across the East Midlands are set to benefit from improved journey times to and from London and Birmingham.</p>
<p>The quicker journey times resulting from HS2 will ‘shift’ the location of major urban areas closer to the East Midlands. London will ‘move’ 60 miles north to Northamptonshire (relative to Derby, Chesterfield &amp; Nottingham). Birmingham will ‘move’ 30 miles northeast to between Derby and Loughborough (relative to Nottingham) meaning residents can get the capital far quicker for work, business or leisure.</p>
<p>The event is being jointly hosted by Midlands Connect and Transport for the East Midlands.</p>
<p><strong>Maria Machancoses, CEO of Midlands Connect commented:</strong></p>
<p>“It’s great to be here in Derby today, highlighting the importance of high-speed rail for this region. The East Midlands is an area so poorly served by rail at the moment; with these proposals in place connections from North to South, and East to West, will be quicker and easier.</p>
<p>“The case for delivering HS2 from Birmingham to the East Midlands is overwhelming.”</p>
<p><strong>Sir Peter Soulsby, Chair of Transport for East Midlands added:</strong></p>
<p>"The East Midlands boasts a resilient and thriving economy which is well placed to reap the benefits of major rail investment.</p>
<p>"HS2 to the East Midlands is key priority for TfEM and will transform links to Birmingham and London.</p>
<p>"With direct HS2 services to Nottingham, Derby and Chesterfield stations, coupled with the electrification of the Midland Main Line, travel times across the region will be significantly reduced and capacity enhanced."</p>
