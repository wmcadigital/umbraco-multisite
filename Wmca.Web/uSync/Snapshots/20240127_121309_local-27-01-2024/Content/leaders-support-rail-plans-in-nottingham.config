            <p>Midlands Connect has submitted a Strategic Outline Business Case to The Department for Transport, calling for an £18m investment to improve journey times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lilian Greenwood,&nbsp;Labour MP for Nottingham South, discussed the plans with business representatives from East&nbsp;Midlands&nbsp;Chamber and Network Rail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A report titled 'All change: The Castle Line', details proposals to make train travel more attractive, reduce car dependence and benefit the local economies.</p>
<p>Currently just 10 per cent of journeys between&nbsp;Nottingham and Lincoln are taken by rail, but if these plans get the go ahead, trains will increase from predominantly&nbsp;50mph to 75mph throughout the route.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CEO of Midlands Connect, Maria Machancoses, said:</strong></p>
<p>“This is an important connection between two major urban areas, and our plans for investment&nbsp;represent the first step in encouraging more passengers to use the trains.</p>
<p>“We recognise the need to make&nbsp;train travel more attractive and help people&nbsp;transition to sustainable transport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our purpose is to create a fairer, greener and stronger Midlands. Faster connections between our towns and cities will bring a boost to the area for all the residents, businesses and visitors.“</p>
<p><strong>Lilian Greenwood,&nbsp;Labour MP for Nottingham South, said:</strong></p>
<p>“We must ensure our transport network is fit for the future, attracting more people to use our railways and bringing investment to boost our economies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I support these plans by Midlands Connect, as a first step in bringing more improvements to this route.“</p>
<p>The plans have been developed with the support of Nottinghamshire County Council, Nottingham City Council,&nbsp;Lincolnshire County Council and the Local Enterprise Partnerships.</p>
<p>Network Rail and local&nbsp;train operator East Midlands Railway (EMR) are also key stakeholders in the process.</p>
<p>Midlands Connect recommends proposed milestones for work to start in April 2026, and complete in&nbsp;Summer 2028.</p>
