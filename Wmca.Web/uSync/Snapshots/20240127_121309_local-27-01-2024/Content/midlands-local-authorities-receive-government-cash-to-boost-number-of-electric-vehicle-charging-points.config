            <ul>
<li><span>Five local authorities, led by Lincolnshire County Council and Midlands Connect, submitted a joint bid for £935,355 Government funding</span><span>in June.</span></li>
<li><span>The successful bid has been made in association with </span>Herefordshire Council, Leicestershire County Council, Rutland County Council, and Stoke-on-Trent City Council.</li>
<li><span> </span><span>In total, the bid will fund&nbsp;322 standard and 27 rapid EV charging points across the Midlands</span><span>.</span></li>
<li>This support from Government is expected to attract an additional £2.8million of private sector investment.</li>
<li><span>Locations for the extra charging points are targeted towards areas with low&nbsp;amount of off-street parking</span><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Five Midlands-based Local Authorities have led a successful bid to get more chargers set-up for on-street convenience&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>A partnership of five local authorities across the Midlands region, alongside Sub-National Transport Body Midlands Connect has led a successful bid for almost £1million of funding aimed at getting more electric vehicle chargers into areas with limited off-street parking.</p>
<p>The bid, aiming to deliver hundreds of new electric vehicle charging points across the Midlands, was made in June focusing on the first tranche of money offered as part of Government’s Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Pilot.</p>
<p>A partnership of five local authorities across the Midlands region – Lincolnshire County Council, Herefordshire Council, Leicestershire County Council, Rutland County Council, and Stoke-on-Trent City Council - alongside Sub-National Transport Body Midlands Connect, submitted the bid. <span>The resulting award of £935,355 is to be distributed between the five councils. </span></p>
<p><span>It is expected that this support from Government will now attract an additional £2.8million of private sector investment, with the cumulative funds being used to install a total of 322 standard and 27 rapid public EV chargers across the Midlands.</span></p>
<p><span>Analysis by Midlands Connect found that the Midlands needs 17,461 new public EV charging points by the end of 2025 to meet the needs of the growing EV market and it’s hoped that this latest good-news around the Government funding will spur on more region-wide installation of charging points.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Estimates suggest that the installation and maintenance of electric vehicle charging points will also&nbsp;create an influx of jobs in the region with over 42,000 related roles set to be created in the Midlands by the end of 2032.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At present, 93% of electric vehicle owners have access to off-road parking. It’s hoped that increasing the number of public charging stations will make it easier for those without a driveway to make the switch to an electric vehicle, while also increasing the ease of travel and charging for all EV users in the county.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Maria Machancoses, CEO of Midlands Connect, said:</strong> “</span>We are delighted that our bid for over 300 charge points to five Local Authorities across the Midlands has been successful.”</p>
<p>“This is a vital next step in our efforts to improve electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the region ahead of the ban of diesel and petrol vehicles in 2030. This funding will improve the lives of those living within the Midlands, particularly for those who do not have access to off-street parking and may struggle to charge their vehicle otherwise.”</p>
<p>“We recently published an EV planning tool to help our Local Authorities better choose charge point locations across the region – this tool along with successful funding is a huge uplift for the whole region”</p>
<p><span><strong>Cllr Martin Hill, leader of Lincolnshire County Council, the authority leading the bid, added:</strong> “This is another success on the road to our future targets for Electric Vehicle use in Lincolnshire.”</span></p>
<p><span>“As a county, we are keen to make greener choices and we know that many Lincolnshire residents and businesses have already, or are planning to, make the switch to an electric vehicle well ahead of the ban on new diesel and petrol car sales in 2030.</span><span>”</span></p>
<p><span>“This successful bid means that we can install more charging points in various locations and is another part of our greener journey for the future.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We live in a very large county. It’s b</span><span>ecause of these longer distances faced by Lincolnshire residents and businesses as part of their daily lives that it is very important we have a comprehensive network of public charging points to instil confidence in longer journeys with electric vehicles.”</span></p>
<p><span>“The success of this bid for funding will have a very positive effect and hopefully encourage further growth in the sector.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Councillor John Harrington, Group Leader for Independents for Herefordshire and Cabinet Member for Infrastructure and Transport said:</strong> “I’m delighted that this successful bid means that we will be able to offer more electric charging facilities across the county which will support our residents and business to make the shift to ultra-low emission vehicles as part our strong commitment to addressing the climate and ecological emergency.”</p>
<p><strong>Councillor Ozzy O’Shea, County Council Cabinet Member for Highways and Transport for Leicestershire County Council, said:</strong> “We’re delighted with the news of a successful bid and it enhances our credentials as a green council. Leicestershire is very much defined by its rural location and motorists will welcome a significant increase in the number of public charging points.”</p>
<p>“The success also serves to further emphasise our commitment to carbon reduction and help to cement our ambitious plans to become net zero by 2045. We can now set to work on bringing in the vital infrastructure.”</p>
