<p><strong>Commenting on the release of National Highways’ Route Strategy Documents, Midlands Connect Maria Machancoses said:</strong></p>
<p>“Midlands Connect welcomes the initial proposals laid out National Highways and we welcome their acknowledgment of our work and the importance of roads like A50/A500, in Grantham, the A46, Junction 28 of the M1 and the A5</p>
<p>“The collective work of the Midlands, created shared priorities and working together, with one voice has really shown to work and that shows clearly through these documents. We understand these plans are at the early stages of development and with tighten public finance and the ever increasing pressures due to climate change it will be extremely important for all of us to continue to work with National Highways in the coming months as these plans evolve.</p>
<p>“Midlands Connect will continue to engage constructively with National Highways and we plan to submit to their consultation on these strategies shortly.”</p>
