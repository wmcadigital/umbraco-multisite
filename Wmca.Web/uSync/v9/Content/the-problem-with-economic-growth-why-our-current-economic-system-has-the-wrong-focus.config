These statistics focus on production and outputs as the key measures for prosperity.<br><br>But more recently, it’s been recognised that these measures don’t tell us all we need to know about the state of our economy, country and people. Afterall, ‘<a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/economic-view-no-matter-what-the-politicians-say-gdp-is-a-distorted-guide-to-economic-performance-and-a-bad-way-to-measure-prosperity-9090467.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">being ill, provided you have to pay drug companies or health systems for treatment, is better for GDP than staying healthy’</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What is GDP?</h2>\\n<p>GDP is <a href=\\\"https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm\\\">defined by the OECD</a> as ‘the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports).’ </p>\\n<p><a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/explainers/what-is-gdp\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">The Bank of England</a> says it is ‘a measure of the size and health of a country’s economy over a period of time’. GDP is considered the single most important indicator of the health of an economy.<br>Put simply, GDP is the value of everything produced in an economy. </p>\\n<h2>The limits of GDP</h2>\\n<p>GDP is still a useful measure. It’s used globally and it can be helpful to track and compare countries. Though strictly speaking, GDP is a measure of economic outputs in the form of goods and services and is not meant to be a measure of welfare and wellbeing. It isn’t a good at measuring welfare either. The metric does a great job at what it is supposed it but it is often used to track the overall progress of a country.<br><br>It is vital that it should not be used as the most important metric and should only be used to measure production. It only accounts for activity where money changes hands. There is greater context beyond how much a country produces that is needed to make judgements about the overall wellbeing of a country. GDP, or indeed GDP per capita (GDP divided by the population to give an average), can’t tell us about unpaid productivity such as unpaid care nor can it tell us about how wealth is distributed across society.</p>\\n<h2>Trickle down economic – the link between GDP and people</h2>\\n<p>Traditional economics taught in universities tells us that demand creates its own supply. This means that if people have the money to purchase things that they want (demand goods and services), then they must have the money (there must be wealth within that country) to purchase goods.<br><br>This is why production and consumption are seen to be related to prosperity.<br><br>As well as this there is a belief in economics that when a country is wealthy, even if that wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small group, it will trickle down to everyone.<br><br>Trickledown economics tell us the wealthier those at the top are, the better life will get for all. This is because of the belief that when those with wealth spend money or invest, they create jobs. This in turn means people are paid salaries which they can then spend.<br><br>The idea is that by paying people salaries, this distributes the wealth. <br>This is not the experience for many people who find that despite living in a country with a high GDP they are still not able to live a fulfilling and good quality life.</p>\\n<h2>More more more – endless growth</h2>\\n<p>GDP and GVA are measures of production and output. They focus on goods and services produced as a measure of productivity and vitality in an economy. However, this focus means that economic progress is coupled with consumption, in other words the purchasing of stuff.<br><br>Constant growth means more and more production and consumption. Producing and consuming goods at a rapid and ever-growing rate is both energy, and resource intensive. This means taking advantage of our planet by over utilising its resources. This is unsustainable and continuing this trajectory will destroy our planet.<br><br>So, if the current model isn’t working for people or the planet what are our options. If growth isn’t the goal, then what should we be focusing on?<br><br>An alternative is a model of growth that focuses more on what matters to our people like creating thriving communities with healthy and happy people while respecting our planet.
