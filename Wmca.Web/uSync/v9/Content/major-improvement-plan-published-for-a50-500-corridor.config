<p><span data-contrast="auto">Today (23</span><span data-contrast="auto">rd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> February) regional transport body Midlands Connect has released a major report outlining a series of improvements to A50/A500 corridor. The upgrades are targeted at reducing congestion, supporting local businesses and promoting greener transport use – including the take up of electric vehicles. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The plans from Midlands Connect could create a £12 billion economic boost and help to unlock over 12,000 jobs. New research released alongside the report shows that drivers are losing over half an hour (37 minutes) every weekday due to congestion on this vital route. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The report, called </span><span data-contrast="auto"><a href="/{localLink:umb://document/409060b095744c20b59bcb9b78787589}" title="Levelling up the A50/500: The Road to Success">Levelling-up Stoke, Staffordshire, Derby &amp; Derbyshire: The road to success</a> </span><span data-contrast="auto">outlines a series of strategic recommendations for long-awaited upgrades, badly needed to alleviate bottlenecks along the 90km long A50/A500 corridor, which links Derby, Nottingham and Leicester to Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire and the North-West.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Large manufacturers such as JCB, Rolls-Royce, Toyota and Alstom rely on this key East-West route to keep supply chains moving and provide links to international markets – currently, traffic congestion on the A50/A500 threatens to stand in the way of business growth. The route sees between 60,000 to 90,000 vehicles passing along it every single day. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With deadlines to secure funding via the Department for Transport’s Road Investment Strategy (RIS) schemes fast approaching, Midlands Connect is working closely with local authorities and other partners to help turn its plans into reality. By putting together a phased, corridor wide approach, it is hoped that improvements can be brought forward and provide good value for money, something that has previously been a barrier to progress. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“This report released today outlines why upgrades to the A50/A500 manufacturing corridor are crucial both to keep international markets open after Brexit and to reduce emissions by enabling more direct and efficient journeys. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“This suggested strategic enhancement plan from Midlands Connect is based on comprehensive research which proves just how economically important this 90km East-West stretch of road between Crewe and Derby is. Improvements will also make it easier for business and local communities to prepare for a future where electric vehicles and alternative fuels become the norm. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“A key location for manufacturing and industrial activity due to its fantastic links with major UK cities and local supply chains, the corridor is home to industry leading businesses including JCB, Toyota, Rolls Royce and Alstom, and will soon link the new HS2 hubs at Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent with the planned freeport close to East Midlands Airport. However, the busy A50/ A500 has slowly become more congested over time and regular bottlenecks form at junctions during peak times. Widespread development is planned for the surrounding area, meaning that change is needed now, with this sustainability-led plan to keep locals, employees and businesses moving.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“As MP for Burton and Uttoxeter, I know that our region is an extremely important part of the UK’s wider economy.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“The upgrade of the A50/A500 corridor is vital to the future growth of Staffordshire and our neighbours. As a county council we have set out our economic development priorities which includes improving our strategic transport routes. One of our key strengths is our location being at the heart of the country – with east/west connectivity becoming ever more important. Reducing congestion and ensuring there is good traffic flow means we can increase investment in our area, support our existing businesses to expand and new ones to be set up, whilst create more opportunities for our communities.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
