<p>A 13-year-old schoolboy who smashed windows on buses on four separate occasions in August this year has been made subject of a Restorative Justice session (RJ). The boy, from Solihull, spent four hours of his Christmas holiday yesterday cleaning buses as part of the victim awareness session.</p>
<p>Safer Travel anti-social behaviour officer Sharon Courtney said: 'Restorative justice is a valuable&nbsp;tool to address low level criminality and ASB. It allows us to highlight to perpetrators the impact their behaviour has had whilst keeping them out of the criminal justice system. This young man fully embraced his time with us and left with a better understanding of the consequences of his behaviour.'</p>
<p>Sharon was joined by Katie Potter from National Express West Midlands and Transport Safety Officers (TSO's) from Transport for West Midlands, to help oversee the process.&nbsp;</p>
