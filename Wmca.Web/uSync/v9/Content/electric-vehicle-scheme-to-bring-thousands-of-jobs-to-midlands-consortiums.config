It will also bring an additional £1.46bn in environmental benefits from supporting the transition from fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles.  </p>\n<p>The Midlands EVI Consortiums have secured funding from the Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) Fund – a government-funded programme which supports councils to install electric vehicle charge points with additional private investment from charge point operators, is likely to support approximately 11,000 jobs in the whole electric vehicle charging supply chain. </p>\n<p>In September 2023, Midlands Connect partnered with Local Authorities for a total of £40.3m of the LEVI Fund, accounting for 61% of the region’s £66.5m funding. </p>\n<p>The scheme is expected to create direct and indirect jobs across the charge point supply chain. Of these, 2,000 will be during the development phase of the scheme, with a further 9,000 roles to be created during the 15-year operational phase, supporting the Midlands region, UK and wider charging infrastructure. </p>\n<p>The news comes following Midlands Connect’s Electric Vehicle Conference, which took place virtually last week. Leaders from across the industry shared visions on the electric revolution, from charging infrastructure to fleet electrification. </p>\n<p><strong>Maria Machancoses, CEO of Midlands Connect, said: </strong></p>\n<blockquote>“These figures really show the importance of investing in green transport. As the UK moves towards Net Zero, there must be more green jobs and investment, especially in an industrial region such as the Midlands. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>“Electric car and fleet use is on the rise so it’s great to see the funding for infrastructure will have such a positive impact, it will create thousands of jobs across the region.” </blockquote>"
