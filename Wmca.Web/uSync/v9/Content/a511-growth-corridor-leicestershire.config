The improvement scheme will future-proof this already busy route by widening carriageways and improving junction access along the corridor.The scheme will encourage active travel by providing new pedestrian crossings and upgrading existing pedestrian crossings to also accommodate cyclists.</p>\n<h2>What will the scheme do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Support business</strong>: Reduce congestion, improving access to businesses located adjacent to the A511, including businesses such as Amazon and Pallex.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide new jobs and homes</strong>: Improve access toover 5,000 planned new homes and releasing land along the corridor, resulting in new employment opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide vital routes during construction of HS2</strong>: During the construction of HS2, traffic will be diverted along the A511 due to a construction compound at A42 Junction 12.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Midlands Connect submitted the A511 Growth Corridor to the Department for Transport for Major Road Network funding.<br><br>The Department for Transport awarded funding to support the development of an Outline Business Case in September 2019. In 2020, Leicestershire County Council submitted the Outline Business Case and if it is approved, it can create a more detailed, Full Business Case for the improvements.</p>"
