            <p>A poll asked 1,000 people in Nottingham, Newark and Lincoln if they would back line speed upgrades, and the results showed 79% support the plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midlands Connect submitted a Strategic Outline Business Case to The Department for Transport, earlier this year, calling for £18m to improve journey times to make train travel more attractive along the route, reduce car dependence and benefit the local economy.</p>
<p>By relocating a signal unit,&nbsp;minor track re-alignment and&nbsp;structural repairs to existing culverts, the speed will increase from&nbsp;predominantly&nbsp;50mph to 75mph throughout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, just 10 per cent of journeys between&nbsp;Nottingham and Lincoln are made by train.</p>
<p>The survey showed:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A resounding 83% said they would expect to see a boost to the economy as a result of this project</li>
<li>70% of the participants said increasing the speed between Nottingham and Lincoln would encourage them to take the train&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Reduced road congestion, local economic growth and decreased traffic emissions were the top three benefits identified by respondents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Midlands Connect, Integrated Transport Programme Lead, Tawhida Yaacoub&nbsp;said:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“Support for these much-needed improvements is overwhelming. We know very few people are travelling between these major urban areas by train.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We need to argue the case for investment to attract more passengers, and people clearly support the plans. These results show they will choose to travel by train if this project gets the go-ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The economic benefits also stood out in the survey responses, with a large majority of people recognising our plan to upgrade this rail route will create growth in the area. They know&nbsp;it will be good for residents and businesses."</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Robert Jenrick, MP for Newark:</strong></p>
<p>“I recognise the importance of strong transport links to the community in Newark, and beyond. It's clear to see the strong support for this project and for its potential to bring economic growth.</p>
<p>“These plans to improve train travel will inevitably bring a boost to the local area and beyond, and help to attract more people to the trains in the future.“</p>
<p>The business case has been developed with the support of Nottinghamshire County Council, Nottingham City Council,&nbsp;Lincolnshire County Council and the Local Enterprise Partnerships.</p>
<p>Network Rail and local&nbsp;train operator East Midlands Railway (EMR) are also key stakeholders in the process.</p>
<p>Midlands Connect recommends proposed milestones for work to start in April 2026, and complete in&nbsp;Summer 2028.</p>
