Our work is based on four case studies in England, one of which is Dudley, where we find clear evidence of some of the ‘success factors’ found in other international cities.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Our report concludes that to replicate international success, public funding in England needs to be longer-term, less fragmented and more flexible. This is the principle that lies behind the West Midlands’ Single Settlement, currently being negotiated with government on the back of last year’s devolution deal.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">We are not the only organisation calling for a renewed approach to devolution and local funding and finance. The latest report from Harvard University’s series on closing Britain’s regional divides has recommended giving English sub-regional leaders a multi-year financial settlement for devolved matters including ‘compensatory investment for historic underspending’ in some UK regions. And New Local have a new report out making the case for place-based budgets too.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Devolution may not be an end in itself, but as we head into election season, there is a growing body of evidence that shows that access to local knowledge and a willingness to collaborate can accelerate levelling up across the UK, leading to a better quality of life for West Midlands communities.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><strong>Jeffrey Matsu</strong> <br>Chief Economist, CIPFA</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/documents/research-and-insights/wise-newsletter-march-2024/\\\">Read more in the March 2024 WISE newsletter</a>.</p>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"settingsData\": []\n}",
