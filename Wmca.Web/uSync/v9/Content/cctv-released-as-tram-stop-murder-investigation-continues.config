<div><span>A 31-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a man at Soho Benson Road tram stop.</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>He is currently in police custody assisting detectives with their enquiries.</div>

<div>
<div><span>Officers are still keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the Benson Road area between 4pm and 5pm on Friday 31 March to call us 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016 quoting 392 of 31 March.</span></div>

<div><span>Update Saturday 1 April, 2.15pm:</span></div>
<div>
<div>Detectives are continuing their enquiries into the murder of a man who was found at Soho Benson Road tram stop, Winson Green, yesterday (31 March). Officers now believe the man was stabbed on the footpath leading away from the tram stop.</div>

<div>Anyone who was travelling on the trams or who may have been in the surrounding area at the time is urged to contact British Transport Police if they have information.</div>

<div>Detective Chief Inspector Paul Langley said: &ldquo;We now know that the victim was found collapsed at the tram stop around 4.30pm, having suffered serious stab wounds.</div>

<div>&ldquo;My detectives are trying to establish the events leading up to that point, and crucially, how the man came to sustain these injuries.</div>

<div>&ldquo;We have several lines of enquiry, including &nbsp;reviewing CCTV footage, and we now know the victim got off of the tram alone at Soho Benson Road and we believe he was injured on the footpath leading away from the stop.</div>

<div>&ldquo;This was approaching rush hour on a Friday evening and I’m sure there were many people around who may have seen something that could help us.</div>

<div>&ldquo;Were you travelling on the tram network yesterday afternoon between 4pm and 5pm? Did you see anyone suspicious or an altercation take place in the area around Benson Road? Even if you think the information you have is insignificant, it could really help our investigation.&rdquo;</div>

<div>Please contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016 with information. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity, Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.</div>
