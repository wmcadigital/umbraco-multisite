      "richText": "<div class=\"summary\">\n<p>Research by Midlands Connect shows that nearly three quarters (73%) of local residents support the completion of the Newark bypass.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n<p>Consumer research done for Midlands Connect by Censuswide shows that more than one in three (35%) fully support the completion of the Newark bypass and a further 38% support it to some extent. Only 9% don’t support the scheme.</p>\n<p>70% think the completion of the bypass could boost the economy and create jobs and 44% believe the scheme could be deemed as levelling up.</p>\n<p>Last week Midlands Connect released our report proposing upgrades and finishing the Newark bypass. The £400 - £500 million scheme has been dubbed as ‘imperative’ by Midlands Connect chairman Sir John Peace. The “Last piece of the puzzle” report outlines an upgrade scheme which will:</p>\n<p>•        Improve traffic signals at Farndon roundabout to achieve smoother traffic flows in peak hours.</p>\n<p>•        Plan new dual-carriageway bridge over the A1.</p>\n<p>•        Enlarge and partial signalling of Winthorpe roundabout to reduce congestion and improve journey reliability.</p>\n<p>•        New grade separated junction at the Cattle Market roundabout.</p>\n<p><strong>Commenting on the research, Integrated Transport Programme Lead Swati Mittal said:</strong></p>\n<p>“This much-needed upgrade will bring safer and more reliable journeys both for the local communities enduring delays. The improvements will also provide an economic boost for communities across the region, supporting growth and development.</p>\n<p>“Congestion is only going to get worse here around Newark, so we want to act now to develop this modified route and help build a better, safer road network.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cllr Richard Davies, Vice-Chair of Transport for the East Midlands, said:</strong></p>\n<p>\"Improvements to the Newark Bypass are essential to unlocking the full potential of the A46 as a vital national trade corridor, driving economic growth in the region.</p>\n<p>\"Improvements to the bypass remain TfEM's top strategic road priority, and this research shows that completing this work is a local priority too.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Hardy, Newark Business Club - Action Group Chair added:</strong></p>\n<p>\"As a business club we are fully supportive of this scheme and it's long term benefits. Newark is an important gateway to and from the Midlands for ports for business and the coast for leisure, the current road configuration has not been acceptable for years.</p>\n<p>\"Improving the infrastructure will have a positive impact on local businesses in and around town as current congestion levels put consumers off visiting. It will also open up opportunities for investment, bringing jobs to the area.\"</p>\n</div>"
