            "textbox": "<p>Every month, we publish the West Midlands Insights on Society and Economy (WISE) Newsletter. In this month's issue, we take a deep dive on some of the latest insights around our digital economy. Here's a foreword from this month's guest editor:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Welcome to the fourth edition of the WISE Newsletter. Following the publication of the latest Ofcom Connected Nations report, and launch of the refreshed WM Digital Roadmap (details in section 2.2), our editorial this month focuses on the opportunities for digital technologies to transform our region. </p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Universal access to fast and reliable mobile and broadband connectivity is the foundation of our digital economy. The latest independent Umlaut data confirms that the West Midlands has extended its leadership as the best connected region for 5G (outside of London) – with over 65% 5G geographic coverage – and the December Ofcom Connected Nations report shows our relative advantage in gigabit broadband – with 94% of premises having access versus 79% in the UK overall. This reflects the unique partnership between operators, Local Authorities and Government led by WM5G. </p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">But there remain significant parts of the West Midlands that don’t have access to fast and reliable mobile and broadband connectivity. For example, there are over 100,000 premises that don’t have and are unlikely to get access to gigabit broadband in the next three years and the region is not yet achieving its fair share of full fibre broadband investment. In addition the latest Ofcom data shows over a-third of households are struggling to afford connectivity during the cost-of-living crisis. </p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The WMCA and WM5G are committed to address these issues and go further by accelerating the adoption of 5G and fibre, data &amp; AI and sensors to boost economic growth and transform public services. Despite the West Midlands’ digital strengths, the region ranks as 6th out of 12 UK regions for business ICT adoption overall – reflecting the impact of Covid on the sectors the region is strong in as well as long-standing skills and productivity challenges. Hence the WMCA and WM5G are delighted to have won £3.8m of Government investment to accelerate the adoption of 5G, data &amp; AI in the advanced manufacturing and social care &amp; housing sectors – working closely with their partners JLR and the WMCA constituent Local Authorities. In addition, as part of the Deeper Devolution Deal secured in April 2023, the WMCA and WM5G are leading a pioneering programme called Smart City Region to scaling the adoption of key technologies to accelerate hospital discharges, speed-up cancer diagnosis and boost wellness &amp; prevention.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">By accelerating the adoption of new technologies, the region will not only transform the demand-side sectors that it’s strong in – creating skilled jobs, boosting productivity and wellness and attracting inward investment – but it will also accelerate the growth of the West Midlands £15 Billion tech sector – creating more successful scale-up businesses, following in the footsteps of SCC, Gymshark and others. The potential of the latter is evidenced by recent analysis showing that there are already 300 AI businesses in the Midlands (11% of the national total) – a growth of 122% in the last decade.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Robert Franks, Managing Director, WM5G Limited</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/documents/research-and-insights/wise-newsletter-january-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full newsletter here.</a></p>"
