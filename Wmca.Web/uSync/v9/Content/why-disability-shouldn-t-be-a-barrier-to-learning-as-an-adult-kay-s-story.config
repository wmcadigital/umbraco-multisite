But when you hear other people’s stories, you know you are not alone. I also thought I’m not going to be able to do this and then as the weeks went on, I’ve got better and better. I can only go forward now. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">\"I want to let everyone know that there are people out there to help and open doors for you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">\"The tutors make you feel at home – they don’t judge, they help you. If you get something wrong, they show you another way of doing it. Ultimately, they have so much patience. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">\"The more you go to the classes, the more your confidence goes up because you are achieving more. When I get something right, it gives me a buzz. It makes me want to jump and scream, let it all out. You feel good in yourself as you have achieved something that you think wouldn’t be able too. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">\"The Multiply course has taught me how to understand bills, wage slips and tax credit. My husband used to do it all for me but now I’m starting to do it myself which I’m really proud of. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">\"I would recommend Multiply to anybody that’s struggling with maths because it helps with day-to-day things such as shopping and helping the kids with their homework.\" </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\">Inspired<strong> by Kay? <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/what-we-do/employment-and-skills/skills-for-life-numeracy-courses/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">Find out more about Multiply. </span></a></strong></h4>",
