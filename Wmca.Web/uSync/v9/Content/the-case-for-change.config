In the last blog we wrote about the <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/368e1c6d24224c12b7fb1d445c03f75c}\" title=\"The problem with economic growth: why our current economic system has the wrong focus?\">issues with the current economic system</a>. Whilst GDP is a good measure of productivity, we recognised it doesn’t give us a comprehensive enough understanding of how well a country is doing. We also looked at how wealth doesn’t always ‘trickle down’. So, if GDP isn’t the perfect measure, what should we be measuring? </p>\n<p>There are a number of different alternative measures to GDP which look beyond productivity and output. The United Nations has its Sustainable Development Goals which look at creating prosperity as well as looking after our planet. Ultimately, we should be measuring the things that are most important to our people and planet. </p>\n<h3>The 20 measures that matter most to national wellbeing  </h3>\n<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) carried out an engagement activity where they asked people what matters most to national wellbeing. the study found that the following issues were the most important: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Subjective and emotional well-being  </li>\n<li>Good mental health and availability of mental health support  </li>\n<li>Good physical health  </li>\n<li>Social networks and meaningful relationships  </li>\n<li>Community connections, cohesion and belonging  </li>\n<li>Culture of care and support for each other  </li>\n<li>Reduction of inequalities and discrimination  </li>\n<li>Financial security, having money and being able to live comfortably  </li>\n<li>Availability of social security and welfare support  </li>\n<li>Quality and accessibility of public services  </li>\n<li>Housing that is affordable, secure and of good quality </li>\n<li>Good working lives, satisfaction with jobs and work-life balance  </li>\n<li>Personal development opportunities  </li>\n<li>Pursuing hobbies, interest, and free-time activities  </li>\n<li>Physical safety and security of individuals and spaces  </li>\n<li>Access to green spaces  </li>\n<li>Stable economy  </li>\n<li>Trust that government is capable and represents the people  </li>\n<li>Democratic values and civic participation </li>\n<li>Protection of the natural environment.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Common themes – signs of success </h3>\n<p>The responses to the ONS research on the issues which matter most to national wellbeing seem to have some common themes. There seem to be eight patterns: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Health and wellbeing  </li>\n<li>Society and community </li>\n<li>Reducing inequality </li>\n<li>Finances, employment and the economy  </li>\n<li>Personal development </li>\n<li>Housing and safety </li>\n<li>Governance and participation </li>\n<li>The environment. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW100790352 BCX0\">What does this mean for how we measure performance of our regions?</span> </h3>\n<div class=\"OutlineElement Ltr SCXW167312258 BCX0\">\n<p class=\"Paragraph SCXW167312258 BCX0\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW167312258 BCX0\">We can tell that the wellbeing of our country is dependent on more than just GDP.
