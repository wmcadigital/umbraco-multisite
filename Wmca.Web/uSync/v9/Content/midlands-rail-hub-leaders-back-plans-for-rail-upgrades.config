The first phase of the Midlands Rail Hub will mean an additional train every hour in both directions between central Birmingham and locations including Bristol, Cardiff, Cheltenham &amp; Worcester. When delivered in full, the hub will see services on most routes increase by between 50% and 100%. Birmingham’s Cross-City line will be given a ‘turn-up-and-go’ service with a train every 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>The statement from the leaders, portfolio holders and business chiefs says:</p>\n<blockquote>“We welcome the news that funding has been announced for the Midlands Rail Hub. The funding we have now received will enable us to finalise the design and finally kick start the delivery of Midlands Rail Hub - allowing extra services initially from Birmingham to Worcester, Cardiff and Bristol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Although this funding is for one section of the project, we are progressing at pace with the Rail Hub’s \"Eastern\" scope securing - as set out in Network North's proposals - improved rail connections between Birmingham and key destinations in the East Midlands like Leicester, Nottingham and Derby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>“Through our Midlands Connect partnership and WMRE and Transport for the East Midlands, we will continue to work with government to ensure the benefits of the Rail Hub ripple throughout the region including communities like Hereford and Lichfield. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>“When delivered in full, Midlands Rail Hub will create faster and more frequent east-west journeys including 14 million extra seats every year. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>“Our message to government is clear: The £123m is very welcome and we must now work together, full steam ahead, to get the project off the ground.”</blockquote>\n<p>Signed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Councillor Simon Geraghty, Leader of Worcestershire County Council</li>\n<li>Councillor Nick Rushton, leader, Leicestershire County Council</li>\n<li>Philip White, Staffordshire County Council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for economy and skills</li>\n<li>Councillor Carolyn Renwick, Derbyshire County Council’s Cabinet Member for Infrastructure and Environment</li>\n<li>Councillor Marjory Bisset, Joint Leader of Worcester City Council</li>\n<li>Councillor Ozzy O’Shea, Leicestershire County Council Cabinet lead for transport</li>\n<li>Sir Peter Soulsby, Mayor, Leicester City Council</li>\n<li>Henrietta Brearley, CEO of the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce</li>\n<li>Maria Machancoses, CEO, Midlands Connect</li>\n<li>Roger Mendonca, Chief Executive Midlands Engine</li>\n</ul>"
