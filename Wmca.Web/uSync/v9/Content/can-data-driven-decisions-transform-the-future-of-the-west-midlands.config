I am connecting with various internal stakeholders across the WMCA to gather a deeper understanding of their data needs. By synthesising these conversations, I hope to facilitate collaboration between the WMCA, its constituent local authorities, and UK government departments to build and strengthen networks that ease data access, build trust and accountability in data usage, and strengthen local data capabilities more broadly. </p>\n<h2>Fostering Data Access and Collaboration for Enhanced Outcomes </h2>\n<p>While the deeper devolution deal and the single settlement provide the WMCA with more freedom for funding distribution, it is essential to recognise where the most help is needed.</p>\n<p>Accessing the right data at the right time enables the WMCA to make better-informed decisions to deliver improved outcomes for residents and communities. Greater autonomy, alongside greater accountability, ensures that devolution ultimately benefits residents by creating a better-connected West Midlands that is fairer, greener, healthier, and responsive to local needs and aspirations. </p>\n<h2>Initial Insights and Future Directions </h2>\n<p>My interest in social justice drives me to find solutions that not only deepen the data capability of the WMCA and its local authorities but also resonate with local communities at their core. Although six months may not suffice for delivering a large-scale project effectively across the entire combined authority, my support within the teams working on delivery enables me to understand where the most capacity is needed. This understanding empowers me to undertake a project that supports building stronger data capability and aligns with the Inclusive Growth Framework. </p>\n<p>Empowering growth through deeper devolution in the West Midlands requires a strategic approach, where data is harnessed for informed decision-making and collaboration is fostered to enhance outcomes. The single funding settlement marks a significant step forward, providing the WMCA with the flexibility and control needed to drive economic growth and deliver tangible benefits for residents. The WMCA is poised to create a fairer, greener, and healthier West Midlands, responsive to the needs and aspirations of its communities by addressing information challenges and building robust data capabilities. </p>\n<p><em>Martin Gozzi is a Data for Policy Fellow at the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) hosted through the Dept of Information Studies, UCL and International Public Policy Observatory (IPPO). With experience as a Data Analyst at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and a Research Assistant in the University of Winchester's Health and Wellbeing Department, Martin has a strong foundation in data analysis and social justice research. Their academic focus on queer and trans studies drives their commitment to fair access to mental health services for the LGBTQ+ community. In their fellowship, Martin will support WMCA in enhancing data maturity and capabilities across the organisation, aligning with WMCA's goal of inclusive growth. </em></p>"
