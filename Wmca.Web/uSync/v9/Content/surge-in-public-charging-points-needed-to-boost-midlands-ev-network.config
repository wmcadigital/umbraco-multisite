<li>Exclusive research shows lack of&nbsp;public EV&nbsp;chargers&nbsp;is a concern for over half of motorists&nbsp;</li>

<li>Midlands&nbsp;needs&nbsp;11&nbsp;new&nbsp;public EV chargers a day, 76 every week or 3,941 every year until the end of the decade&nbsp;</li>
<li>Londoners have access to over 2x as many public EV chargers than&nbsp;Midlanders, despite being 40% less likely to own a car</li>
<li>A third of Midlands households don’t have access to off-road parking so would rely on public chargers to power their EV<span style="color: #bf589d; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">New analysis&nbsp;by Midlands Connect&nbsp;suggests that urgent action is needed to speed up the installation of electric vehicle charging points (EVCPs)&nbsp;across the Midlands&nbsp;region. ‘Supercharging the Midlands’, a report authored by&nbsp;the sub-national&nbsp;transport body, suggests that EV use&nbsp;will&nbsp;increase&nbsp;by over&nbsp;3,000% by the end of the decade, and that installation of public EV charging points&nbsp;must be six times as fast&nbsp;to support growing demand.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At present, 93% of EV owners have access to off-street parking and can install an at-home EV charger, however, a third of Midlands households do not have off-street parking, and so would need to rely solely on public chargers to power their EV.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Research with over 3,500 people across the Midlands reveals that a lack of public charging points is a concern for&nbsp;55% of motorists&nbsp;and is a factor that puts them off switching to an EV. Anxiety about battery range was also an issue for&nbsp;half&nbsp;of respondents.&nbsp;Despite these concerns, 77% of those questioned (with access to a petrol/diesel vehicle) would consider buying an EV next.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Estimates suggest that by 2030, the Midlands could be home to over 1.7million EVs, with over 1 in 4 vehicles being electric.&nbsp;At the moment&nbsp;less than one in&nbsp;every one&nbsp;hundred vehicles&nbsp;is&nbsp;an EV.&nbsp;To support this growing number of EVs, 39,410 new public EV charging points must be installed across the Midlands by the end of the decade. This means installing 11 new EVCPs every day, 76 per week, and 3,491 per year until the end of 2030. The speed of installations needed to meet these targets is over six times the current rate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Although private investment in public EVCPs is available, many local authorities struggle to secure financial backing for sites that are less-commercially viable, particularly those in rural&nbsp;or residential&nbsp;locations, while limited capacity at National Grid sub-stations also presents operational challenges. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Transport bosses are concerned that a failure to increase public charger installations could slow down the take up of EVs and have negative environmental consequences.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">While carbon emissions in the energy industry have fallen by 63%&nbsp;between 1990 and 2019, the transport sector has seen a fall in emissions of just 5% in the same period. The UK’s carbon emissions must fall by 100% (based on 1990 levels) by 2050 to meet climate targets. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Maria Machancoses, Chief Executive of Midlands Connect, said:  &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“We’re in the grip of a climate emergency, and when it comes to installing EV charging points, the Midlands cannot fall behind. We know that being worried about not being able to charge when&nbsp;needed is a major factor that puts many off making their next car electric; this needs to change. By working together to create a region-wide EV strategy and overcome the challenges of installing the infrastructure we need, we can move one step closer to decarbonising our transport network.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Local Authorities across the Midlands are doing a great job to roll out charging points, but they cannot do this alone. Government, the automotive industry and private suppliers must all play a part in speeding up the roll out and ensuring councils have the support they need.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
