<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">A 49-year-old man has been sentenced to seven months in prison after he racially abused a Safer Travel officer and assaulted a member of custody staff.</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">David Mcphail, of no fixed address, was approached by officers outside Snow Hill train station on Wednesday (17/02) when he was seen having a heated argument with station staff, in which he was&nbsp;being abusive and had smashed a glass bottle on the floor nearby.</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">McPhail was arrested and taken into custody where he continued to assault staff, using racist language towards a Safer Travel officer and later throwing a cup of boiling coffee at a custody assistant, causing scalding to her chest and face.</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Following his appearance at Birmingham Magistrates Court yesterday (Thursday), Mcphail pleaded guilty to two offences and was sentenced to a total of seven months in prison for assault causing actual bodily harm and racially aggravated intentional harassment/alarm/distress. </span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Mcphail received consecutive sentences from the court for the two offences due to his flagrant disregard for people and their property. </span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Inspector Rachel Crump, head of the Safer Travel policing team, said: &ldquo;We fully welcome the sentence given for a violent and completely unacceptable attack on a police officer and staff member.</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">&ldquo;We take the safety of our staff very seriously and we will not tolerate violent behaviour or hate crimes towards officers who are simply just doing their job.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;"></span></p>
