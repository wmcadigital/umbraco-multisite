            "textbox": "<p>The role of research and insights is to help ensure decision-makers – from elected officials to community leaders – have the right evidence, at the right time, to make the right decisions. That’s a key part of what we deliver at West Midlands Combined Authority to enable the region to become a better connected, more prosperous, fairer, greener and healthier region.</p>\n<p>We have ambitious plans for our research ecosystem. Here’s four ways our research will develop over the coming year.</p>\n<h4>1) We are transforming how research is coordinated and commissioned</h4>\n<p>Until 2011, Advantage West Midlands operated a 'West Midlands Regional Observatory'. The Observatory’s role was to provide research, facts and figures for the region. Since then, the research and insights landscape in the region has changed a lot. Our towns and cities now host their own best-in-class platforms. This ranges from 'Birmingham City Observatory' to the Coventry 'Citywide Intelligence Hub' and Wolverhampton’s 'WVInsight'. They do an outstanding job at meeting local needs. A one-sized-fits-all regional observatory cannot and should not replicate those platforms.</p>\n<p>For that reason, we are <em>not</em> re-creating a regional observatory. Instead, we are using our position as a partner <em>amongst equals</em> to build a thriving research ecosystem. This is in line with our power and participation <a href=\"https://wmca.org.uk/inclusivegrowth/\"><em>inclusive growth</em></a> fundamental. It is also in line with the type of devolution we are pursuing. That is, we are not seeking to replicate the power structures of Whitehall at the regional level; but to return power to our communities.</p>\n<h4>2) We are making better use of data and analytics in line with the West Midlands Digital Roadmap</h4>\n<p>In 2023, we have made progress towards <em>Conway</em>, our name for the West Midlands datastore; part of the mission of the digital roadmap so that “data is shared effectively across organisations to solve key regional challenges”. At present, we have brought together publicly available regional datasets into Conway, publishing them via our <a href=\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/what-we-do/research-and-insights/data/\">WISE Data Profiler and WISE Data Correlator on our website</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, we hope to further develop <em>Conway</em> by making more internal and external datasets available through our emerging data partnership with Government, which will enable us to make more data available to partners, and publish more relevant dashboards to meet the needs of our research community.</p>\n<h4>3)  We are working with our research community to help shape the future of the West Midlands.</h4>\n<p>People right across the West Midlands Combined Authority collect, analyse, and interpret data. Their job makes sure that decision-makers have the evidence to make the best decisions for our communities. They are part of our research community.</p>\n<p>We also work with researchers in our local authorities, and in the wider public sector. There are also people with specialist knowledge and expertise elsewhere. These include people in our universities, research centres and private and voluntary organisations. They are also part of our research community.</p>\n<p>However, there are also people in our diverse communities and groups right across the region. They also have specialist and often unique knowledge and expertise. They are also a fundamental part of our research community.</p>\n<p>It is our intention to work with our <em>entire</em> research community – as work up a research programme to shape the future of the West Midlands.</p>\n<h4>4) We are working with our constituent local authorities on how we can pool and share efforts at regional monitoring.</h4>\n<p>In August 2023, we launched the West Midlands Insights on Society and Economy (WISE) Group, a space for insight and intelligence leads from our seven constituent local authorities to share what we’re doing so that we can improve and coordinate economic insight across the West Midlands and ensure that economic measurement products are fit for purpose.</p>\n<p>In October 2023, we published the first of our <a href=\"https://wmca.org.uk/wise/\">monthly <em>WISE</em> newsletter</a>, a monthly newsletter on the trends that matter to the West Midlands across the eight inclusive growth fundamentals. Produced in partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.theeiu.org/\">Economic Intelligence Unit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/city-redi/\">City-Region Economic Development Institute (City-REDI)</a>, the newsletter features metrics co-developed with our constituent local authorities.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, we will be looking at how we can pool together resources more effectively around specific areas, for instance, our understanding of Night Time Economy; as we are more effective as a region when we use our collective power and influence to engage stakeholders.</p>\n<h4>How to get involved in our research community</h4>\n<p>We need your help and support to help create a thriving research ecosystem for our region. For example, you could share your research insights or methodologies on this blog, or, you could work with us on helping us monitor and evaluate policy solutions to address the grand challenges facing our region. We are also keen to hear your ideas and suggestions - and we’re happy to hear from you at <a href=\"mailto:research@wmca.org.uk\">research@wmca.org.uk.</a></p>"
