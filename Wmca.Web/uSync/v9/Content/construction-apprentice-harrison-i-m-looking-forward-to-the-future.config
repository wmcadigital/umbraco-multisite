I ended up speaking to a group of friends who were in the last cohort of apprentices at the Doocey Group. At that moment I’d never heard of the Doocey Group, but my friends really recommended their apprenticeship scheme.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">For those of you that don’t know, Doocey is a civil engineering and utility contractor that operates across the West Midlands and nationally. You can find out more about the group <a href=\\\"https://www.dooceygroup.co.uk/\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Doocey run several apprenticeship open days throughout the year, so I decided to go along and see what it was all about.</p>\\n<p>90 minutes later I was hooked!</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I really liked what I saw. So much so I went straight to their office to apply.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">A few days later I received a text message to say I had been accepted onto their pre-apprenticeship scheme. The pre-apprenticeship was a three-week course at Sandwell College in which I had to do several different tests so they could find out a little more about me.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I must have done quite well because I got offered a full-time apprenticeship with Doocey.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">No two days are the same on this apprenticeship.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I’ve just finished learning about water services, water repair and maintenance which I’ve really enjoyed.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Next, I will be doing electrics for the first time. I also spend some time at Sandwell College where we have to evidence our work which goes towards our end point assessment.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">One piece of advice to anyone thinking about signing up for an apprenticeship would be to go to an open day and see if you would like it. </p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I came to the open day and didn’t know anything. I came out by the end with so much knowledge about the company - my mind was blown.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">And here I am now - on a wage, just bought my first car and everything is going well for me.</p>\\n<h3 class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><strong>By 18-year-old Harrison Dawes<br>An apprentice at the Doocey Group. </strong></h3>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"settingsData\": []\n}",
