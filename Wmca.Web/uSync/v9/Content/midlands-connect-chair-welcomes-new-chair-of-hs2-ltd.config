            <p>“The Midlands is right at the heart of the HS2 rail revolution, and even before the tracks are laid, we’re already seeing the benefits. Under the determined and dedicated chairmanship of Sir David Higgins, Midlands Connect has worked closely with HS2 Ltd on plans to accelerate the economic benefits and ensure as much of the region as possible has access to affordable, rapid mass transit services. I look forward to continuing that relationship under the chairmanship of Sir Terry Morgan.</p>
<p>“I wholeheartedly welcome Sir Terry’s appointment, a man of vast industry experience, expertise and leadership, most recently as Chairman of Crossrail. He will be invaluable to HS2’s continued success as Phase One is built, Phase 2a receives parliamentary approval and the Phase 2b Hybrid Bill is finalised. I look forward to meeting with him soon to ensure Midlands Connect’s own ambitious transport proposals complement this once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebalance the economy.”</p>
