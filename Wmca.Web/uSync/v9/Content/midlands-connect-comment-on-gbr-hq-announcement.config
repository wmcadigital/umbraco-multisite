            <p>The shortlist of six locations included two from the Midlands; Derby and Birmingham. Other locations shortlisted were Crewe, Doncaster, Newcastle, and York. The competition aimed to identify a location with a rich railway heritage, where links to the rail network could help solidify this place as the new home of rail travel in the UK.</p>
<p>After much anticipation, Derby has been announced the winner of this competition.</p>
<p>Our CEO, Maria Machancoses, commented:</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to hear Derby has been selected as the home for the new Great British Railways HQ.</p>
<p>"It is an excellent choice; Derby is right in the heart of the country and is home to the greatest cluster of rail sector businesses in the UK and indeed Europe making it a perfect location for the home of GBR.</p>
<p>"Investing in Derby is a therefore a clear vote of confidence for the rail industry bringing a host of job opportunities to the region and we look forward to working together with GBR on our plans, including the Midlands Rail Hub.”</p>
