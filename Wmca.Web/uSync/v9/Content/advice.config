Stickers in the window to say this has been done will help to deter thieves.</li>\n<li>If your catalytic converter is bolted on, consider welding the bolts for extra security.</li>\n<li>Be aware of anyone looking suspicious working on cars in public areas – they may not be who they say they are.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also visit our Vehicle Crime section above for further tips on securing your vehicle.<br><br>If you’ve been a victim of catalytic converter theft, you can visit www.west-midlands.police.uk for advice on how to report, or text British Transport Police on 61016.<br><br>Always dial 999 in an emergency.</p>\n<h2>See something, say something</h2>\n<h4>Have you experience antisocial behaviour (ASB) on your bus journey?</h4>\n<p>Report it to us.<br><br>Simply text the words “SeeSay” along with details of what’s happened to 81018.<br><br>You can also <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/fe122f104b2d4c38b841a4e3f2f59ef5}\" title=\"Safer Travel\">report an incident of antisocial behaviour online</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"?rmode=max&amp;width=500\" alt=\"Graphic of an eye with the &quot;See something say something&quot; slogan, above instructions of how to report antisocial behaviour on a bus journey.\" width=\"500\" height=\"353\" data-udi=\"umb://media/b5272712faef42eaa28bd76f0a789ee0\" data-caption=\"\"></p>\n<h3>What happens next?</h3>\n<p>You’ll receive an automatic reply confirming that we’ve received your report.<br><br>A team of staff from West Midlands Police and British Transport Police investigate your report.
