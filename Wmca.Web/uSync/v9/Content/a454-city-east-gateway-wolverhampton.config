The improvement scheme will improve journey time reliability for vehicle users, reduce queues and delay and thereby improve air quality in threshold exceedance areas, encourage active travel and prepare the city for exciting new future developments.</p>\n<h2>What is the scheme?</h2>\n<p>The A454 is a busy key route linking the city to the wider Black Country and the strategic motorway network. The improvement scheme will aim to reduce queuing at key junctions, resulting in better air quality within the areas that are above or at the current safe threshold.<br><br>The scheme will also encourage active travel and improve multi-modal travel facilities by reallocating space to include a new pedestrian and segregated cycling facilities. These facilities will support both commuting trips and the needs of the local community that straddle the route.<br><br>It will also support access to the wider travel network including the multi-modal Interchange which is nearing completion with the inclusion of the tram and new developments along the route for housing and employment.</p>\n<h2>What will the scheme do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improve public transport links</strong>: Link to the newly developed Wolverhampton Transport Interchange, providing access to bus, tram and train facilities, along with a cycle hub and taxi services.</li>\n<li><strong>Encourage active travel</strong>: Improve walking and cycling connectivity along the corridor to improve conditions for residents without a private car, also encouraging active travel for shorter journeys.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce delays</strong>: Improve journey time reliability for Wolverhampton residents as well as better linking the city to the rest of the Black Country and UK.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve connectivity</strong>: Enable better access to jobs and leisure in Wolverhampton city centre, Metro and the railway station, which is currently undergoing a major regeneration.</li>\n<li><strong>Unlock housing</strong>: Provide access to proposed housing development, Canalside Quarter. The housing scheme is predicated on sustainable travel will benefit from better access the active and public transport network.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve air quality</strong>: Improve air quality in key areas, bringing air quality within safe and legal limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Midlands Connect submitted the A454 City East Gateway scheme to the Department for Transport for Major Road Network funding. Wolverhampton City Council continues to work with the Department to develop the Outline Business Case.</p>"
