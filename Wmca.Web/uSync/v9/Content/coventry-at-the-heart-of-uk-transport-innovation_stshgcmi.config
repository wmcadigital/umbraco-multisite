            <p>The event will bring together local leaders, leading politicians and rural organisations to discuss transport and innovation issues affecting the region.</p>
<p>The event will also include contributions from Transport for West Midlands, Skyfarer and Warwick Manufacturing Group highlighting key innovation and best practices across the wider region.</p>
<p>After the event demonstrations of drones and some of the innovations that will have been discussed in the morning will be available for attendees and the media.</p>
<p><strong>CEO of Midlands Connect, Maria Machancoses, said:</strong></p>
<p>“Every year I visit and engage with hundreds of businesses and I can say, without a shadow of a doubt that Coventry is at the heart of UK transport innovation. From drone airports to very light rail, the skills and ingenuity being unleashed in the city will be a catalyst for economic growth.</p>
<p>“It’s exciting to see the progress in Coventry, not just foremost in the Midlands but leading the nation in this field.</p>
<p>“I firmly believe everyone in the Midlands wins from this kind of innovation, that is why we are hosting this major conference in Coventry, to share the knowledge and learning and allow other cities to thrive, like Coventry.”</p>
