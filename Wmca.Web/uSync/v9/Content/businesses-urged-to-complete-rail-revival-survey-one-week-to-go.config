            <p>The results of the survey will support the case for further investment on the route. Last year, Midlands Connect released the Building Back Greener report, which outlined the strong case for a direct service between Coventry, Leicester, and Nottingham, reconnecting these three major Midlands cities.</p>
<p>Currently, just 3% of journeys between Coventry and Leicester are made by rail, compared to over 30% of journeys from Coventry to Birmingham. Many people avoid the train for this journey, as having to change at Nuneaton means journeys are longer and more prone to delays. It is hoped that a direct line would allow more people to choose rail over road.</p>
<p>If a direct rail line is built, there will be significant economic benefits to the region, estimated to be worth £179m. Greater connectivity between the three cities could also bring more job opportunities, as well as social and environmental benefits. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The survey takes only a few minutes and can be found&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://midlandsconnect.consultationonline.co.uk/coventry-leicester-nottingham/">here</a><strong>. It closes on Friday 11th November 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Commenting on the survey, Andy Clark, Senior Rail Programme Manager at Midlands Connect, said:</p>
<p>“So far, we have had a great number of responses from local businesses on how they think a direct rail link would impact their organisation.</p>
<p>“With one week to go, we are calling on more employers in the area to share their views, and really help us to build a case for reconnecting these fantastic cities.”</p>
