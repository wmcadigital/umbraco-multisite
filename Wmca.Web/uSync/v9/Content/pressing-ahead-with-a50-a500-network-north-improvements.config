      "richText": "<div class=\"summary\">\n<p>Funding for improvement works to the A50/500 corridor between Stoke and Derby was announced as part of the Government's Network North campaign in October.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n<p>Midlands Connect has refreshed its evidence to Government to make the case for the investment and move forward with this important scheme. </p>\n<p>Proposals developed by Midlands Connect will see parts of the road layout reconfigured to improve road safety and ease traffic flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Machancoses, Chief Executive of Midlands Connect, the sub-national Transport Body for the Midlands, said: </strong>\"This 44-mile long A50/A500 North Midlands Manufacturing Corridor generates an economic output of around £20.3 billion from the areas of Derby, and the Stoke-on-Trent conurbation.</p>\n<p>\"It is a major through route between the M1 to the East and the M6 to the West. Its economy is dominated by road-reliant industries like manufacturing, automotive, and distribution.</p>\n<p>\"As such, the A50/A500 is a nationally significant trade and export artery and we are engaging with local and national partners so we can progress with our proposals at pace following the Network North announcement - key to supporting growth along the corridor.\"</p>\n<p>Midlands Connect met with Burton MP Kate Kniveton, to discuss the plans. She has been campaigning for investment and improvements to the A50 for years.  </p>\n<p><strong>Kate Kniveton, MP for Burton, said:</strong> \"We have world-renowned businesses along this corridor and they need to be able to plan ahead and know that issues with this critical route will be addressed. </p>\n<p>\"Improvements are needed to help ease congestion, tackle delays and improve air quality.</p>\n<p>\"There are a couple of specific roundabouts creating serious pinch points that disrupt traffic flow, but it is also important to look at the whole corridor.</p>\n<p>\"Improvements will benefit housing development in the wider area, and support jobs and economic growth.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Staffordshire County Council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for economy and skills, Philip White, said:</strong></p>\n<p>“The A50/A500 corridor is a critical east/west route for Staffordshire and the wider region, and we’re pleased to be part of the Midlands Connect partnership making the case for these improvements to the Government.</p>\n<p>\"Now this has been included in the projects listed under the Network North proposals we want the Government to ensure it delivers on its commitments.</p>\n<p>“This transport corridor is set to become a national hub for the manufacture of hydrogen engines for vehicles from cars to aeroplanes, in addition to plant and machinery.</p>\n<p>\"Streamlining the route supports our collective ambition to ensure it can become a global centre of excellence in this sector in the future. Delays along the route currently experienced restrict growth, increase costs and cause significant inconvenience.”</p>\n</div>"
