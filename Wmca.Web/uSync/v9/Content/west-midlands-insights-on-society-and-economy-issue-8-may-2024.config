A condensed lead-in, the pandemic, and supply chain disruption had a major impact but all local, national and international partners united to deliver the Games on time and under budget. Our tracks, gyms, sports fields and pools were a high-quality backdrop for Team England to win a record breaking 176 medals, all manufactured in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter. </p>\n<p style=\"border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">My personal highlight was how we used top class sport to bring people together and to develop new skills. The wonderful volunteers from the Commonwealth Collective gave athletes and visitors alike a warm West Midlands welcome. Nearly 12,000 volunteers, nearly two thirds from the West Midlands, gave more than a million hours of their time and were a credit to the region.<span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'DM Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'DM Sans';\"> The Games’ Jobs and Skills Academy helped a further </span>21,000 people (52% from ethnic minority groups) develop skills and kickstart their careers, securing jobs related to the preparation and delivery of the Games.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">  </span></p>\n<p style=\"border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">West Midlands businesses stepped up to capitalise on the commercial opportunities. According to the independent evaluation, the Games boosted the region’s economic output by £516.2m (£1.2bn overall across the UK) during the five years culminating in the summer of 2022. This includes the benefits of the Business and Tourism Programme, expertly led by the West Midlands Growth Company, which attracted additional visitors to the West Midlands and increased visitor spend in the city and region. I’m delighted that the evaluation also recognised the Organising Committee’s efforts, to deliver a carbon neutral Games and, through its procurement, an exemplar social value programme.</p>\n<p style=\"border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, we should be proud of our bold legacy. Over 2,450 schools engaged with the Games and young people are benefitting from the 16,000 pieces of used Games equipment handed out to over 290 West Midlands organisations. Having delivered the Games under-budget, the Government was persuaded to return the £70m surplus to the region in the shape of the Commonwealth Games Legacy Enhancement Fund, which is being disbursed by the Combined Authority. This has been used to support a variety of initiatives across the West Midlands in line with the original legacy ambitions, including the ongoing work of United by 2022, the excellent Games legacy charity.</p>\n<p style=\"border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Through the Global West Midlands programme, the Legacy Fund has continued to invest more widely in the business and tourism opportunities created by the Games. Hosting the Games has enabled the region to secure the 2026 European Athletics Championships as well as 9 regional events across 2024 and 2025, including 2 major E-sports tournaments, the Kabaddi World Cup, Judo junior European cup and cultural events such as Coventry’s Godiva Festival and the Birmingham Weekender. April 2024 also saw the region successfully host 1,500 top global sports administrators and business leaders, for the 2024 Sport Accord summit at the ICC. With Ugur Erdener, the President of Sport Accord, describing the summit as “the best Sport Accord ever”, the West Midlands is absolutely at the Heart of UK Sport, firmly embedded as the Region of choice for hosting major sports events, with all the business and social benefits this will bring.</p>\n<p style=\"border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Ian Metcalfe OBE</strong></p>\n<p style=\"border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Chair of Commonwealth Games England (2014 – 2022), Non-executive director on the Board of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games (2018-2022), and Chair of SportAccord-West Midlands Executive Steering Group (2024)</p>\n<p style=\"border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/what-we-do/research-and-insights/reports/west-midlands-insights-on-society-and-economy-wise/\">Read more in the May 2024 WISE newsletter</a><a href=\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/documents/research-and-insights/wise-newsletter-april-2024/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/documents/research-and-insights/wise-newsletter-march-2024/\"></a>.</p>\n</div>"
