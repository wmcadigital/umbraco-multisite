            <p><strong>Midlands Connect has urged local businesses to let us know their views about improvements on the Shrewsbury-Black Country-Birmingham route. The <a href="/umbraco/midlandsconnect.consultationonline.co.uk/shrewsbury-blackcountry-birmingham">survey is open for another week</a> for firms to let us know their opinions.</strong></p>
<p>The results will be used to help illustrate the need for further investment along the line.</p>
<p>We recently submitted a Strategic outline Business Case to the Department for Transport in August which found that proposed improvements, which would boost line speed to 90 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The project will deliver around £23 million of economic benefits – these relate both journey time improvements alongside improved air quality, environmental benefits and reduced congestion on local roads. The Business Case shows that for every £1 invested, £16 could be created for the local economy.</p>
<p>This business case adds to work released last year in Midlands Connect’s Rails to Recovery report, which also found that electrifying the route through Telford and the Black Country and extending London services to Shrewsbury could create up to £500 million of benefits for businesses and residents by making the trains hourly to the nation’s capital. Midlands Connect analysed plans for a new hourly train from Shrewsbury, Wellington, Telford, Wolverhampton and Birmingham to London.</p>
<p>The survey on the plans will close on Monday, September 5, with results to be announced soon after. To complete the survey, <a href="/umbraco/midlandsconnect.consultationonline.co.uk/shrewsbury-blackcountry-birmingham/">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on the survey’s release, Midlands Connect Senior Rail Programme Manager Tawhida Yaacoub said:</strong></p>
<p>“We are delighted with the amount of businesses who have let us know their views from throughout Shropshire, Telford, the Black Country and Birmingham but with a week to go we are calling on local businesses to log on and fill in the survey.</p>
<p>“It will only take a few minutes and will make a massive difference potentially.”</p>
