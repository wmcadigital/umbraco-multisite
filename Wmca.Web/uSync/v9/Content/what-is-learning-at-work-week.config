These included topics such as Developing a Growth Mindset, Coaching and Mentoring here at West Midlands Combined Authority, Creating a Healthier West Midlands, Introduction to Power BI and the launch of an interactive board game which is now part of our Diversity and Inclusion offer.  </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8.0pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">To highlight Mental Health Awareness Week, there were tips shared to encourage movement which was the theme. An interactive Stay Active session which was externally hosted.  A colleague openly sharing their personal experience with mental health to normalise conversations and remove stigma. We participated in wear it green day and green mental ribbon pins provided to support mental health and wellbeing. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8.0pt 0cm;\"> </p>"
