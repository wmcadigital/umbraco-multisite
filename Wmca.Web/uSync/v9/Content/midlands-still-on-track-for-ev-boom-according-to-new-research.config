      "richText": "<ul>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Midlands could have over 2 million electric cars (EVs) on its roads by 2030</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">58,997 new public charging points will be needed across the region by 2030 to keep pace with the boom – a 969% increase from today</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Research released to coincide with Midlands Connect EV conference held on 7 March </li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">New research from Midlands Connect suggests the Midlands remains on track for an EV boom and could see over 2 million electric cars on its streets by the end of the decade, with a significant increase in public EV charge points needed to keep up with demand. The new projections were announced today at Midlands Connect’s EV Conference.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Figures suggest the Midlands will see a 1,899% increase in uptake in electric vehicles by the end of 2030, with projections predicting to rise from 103,014 EVs today to 2,059,611 on its roads by the end of 2030. These numbers indicate just under a third (32.5%) of all vehicles registered in the Midlands Connect area could be an electric vehicle by the end of 2030.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">New research forecasts have shown the Midlands region requires a further 58,997 public charging points by 2030 to support the increase in EV use over the next decade, a 969% increase from the 6,090 chargers existing across the region today. This equates to the installation of 27 new EVCPs every day, 194 per week, and 9,832 per year until the start of the new decade.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The work is part of the Sub-national Transport Body’s efforts to support Local Authorities in increasing EV charger roll-out. In September 2023, it partnered with 14 Local Authorities for a total of £40.3mil of Government’s Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) Fund to be part of consortium approach, accounting for ~61% of the regions £66.5mil funding.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The figures were announced at Midlands Connect’s EV Conference today, which brought together senior leaders and policymakers to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the Electric Vehicle industry. Discussions included hearing from firms manufacturing EVs; electrifying fleets of vehicles and ensuring that electrified transport is accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Commenting on the research, Midlands Connect’s​ CEO Maria Machancoses said: </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“It’s clear we’re still on the brink of a boom in Electric Vehicles that could see every third car being an electric one by the end of decade.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Local Authorities across the Midlands are doing a great job to roll out charging points, but they cannot do this alone. We’re already working with Local Authorities to support their work and help secure EV infrastructure funding from Government.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Our conference today allowed us to bring together many different aspects of the EV industry, including Government, to discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead. We want to make the Midlands the home of the green industrial revolution.”</p>"
