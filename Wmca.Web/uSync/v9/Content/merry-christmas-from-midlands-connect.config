      "richText": "<div class=\"summary\">\n<p>A message from our CEO, Maria Machancoses</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n<p>At this time of the year, it is a period of family, love and also reflection and as I look back over 2023, I am delighted to say Midlands Connect continues to evolve into a serious and critically effective organisation which, by bringing the Midlands together in one voice, is delivering real and lasting impact for the region.</p>\n<p>2023 has been a year of change more than trends. Rising inflation, the cost-of-living crisis and international conflicts have defined the political and economic agenda in the UK, yet despite these ongoing challenges, the Midlands Connect partnership has remained resilient and committed to create a fairer, greener and stronger Midlands.</p>\n<p>The biggest point of the year was the cancellation of HS2. Obviously, as we said at the time, we were disappointed, but with the Network North announcement we saw a series key Midlands Connect projects at the heart of the Government’s £36 billion plan to improve the region and the country’s transport. The Midlands Rail Hub announcement by the Prime Minister gave me and the team a real moment of pride. The scheme, we have worked on together for eight years is now treated by government as a key, national priority.</p>\n<p>We also saw as part of the package, vital funding to fix two major pinch points on the A5 between Hinckley and Tamworth, funding for improvements to the A50/500 corridor between Stoke and Derby and improving the M6 at Junction 15 between Manchester and Birmingham, as well as funding for seven MRN schemes as varied as A511 Growth Corridor, Chesterfield - Staveley Regeneration Route, A4123 Birchley Island in Sandwell and the A454 between Wolverhampton and East Park Gateway.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just across roads and rail improvements, Midlands Connect has made big progress on areas like alternative fuels and electric vehicle infrastructure. We saw real positive momentum; firstly, nearly a £1 million of funding for our pilot for five councils is nearly at the procurement stage, and now thirteen Midlands Councils collaborate to apply for £39.3 million to get more chargers onto our streets. These two tranches of vital funding are next step in our efforts to improve electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the region. This funding will improve the lives of those living within the Midlands, particularly for those who do not have access to off-street parking and may struggle to charge their vehicle otherwise. The vital funding government has made available is a mark of confidence in Midlands Connect and our role as a key regional convenor.</p>\n<p>As we now look forward to 2024; we plan to progress our work on the economy and freight and release a real roadmap for the future of freight in the region but also UK wide. We will also be doing far more on hydrogen and critical future demonstrators to show what can be done so we can continue to address the global climate emergency.  I also hope in the year ahead we can continue to strengthen our collaborative arrangement with local councils across the region; including working closely with the West Midlands Combined Authority and the emerging Mayoral Combined Authorities in both the East Midlands and Greater Lincolnshire.  We also hope to deepen the strong and collaborative relationships we have with the Department for Transport as well as Network Rail and National Highways.</p>\n<p>Nothing seems to bring people together like Christmas and that spirit is something that Midlands Connect prides itself on. I want to thank my team and all our partners and supporters. We really do appreciate all their support and we look forward to another year of success.</p>\n</div>"
