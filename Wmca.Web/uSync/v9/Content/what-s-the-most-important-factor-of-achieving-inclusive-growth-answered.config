Each ingredient is essential in the prescribed quantity. Take away the flour and you’re left with a sweet but curdled mess. Take away the eggs and the batter won't bind together. Forget the sugar and while the cake may look ok, it's not really a cake.

People’s lives are complex with lots of intertwined aspects. Often their problems are compounded by other issues. This is why trying to solve each problem in isolation of the wider context may not work. A systems approach is needed where we look at the whole picture.</span> </p>\\n<p class=\\\"Paragraph SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"><img src=\\\"?rmode=max&amp;width=500\\\" alt=\\\"A group of people stood together having a conversation with one another.\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"334\\\" data-udi=\\\"umb://media/58dce46336ec4768a02a1a5ef0b78003\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"OutlineElement Ltr SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"Paragraph SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">The fundamentals themselves are interdependent, particularly when look at it from the perspective of an individual. </span> </p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"OutlineElement Ltr SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"Paragraph SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">Meet Tanya, she is a 34-year-old single mother of three children aged nine, five and two. In her early late teens and early 20’s she was the main carer for her elderly grandmother and so, did not go to university. She has been in and out of work but hasn't worked since the arrival of her youngest child.  She has been trying to get back into work which has been quite a stressful experience for her as she struggles to afford childcare for her youngest child. As well as this</span><span class=\\\"TextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\" lang=\\\"EN-GB\\\" data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">,</span></span><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"> many of the jobs she is qualified for do not pay very well and require her to be working on site</span><span class=\\\"TextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\" lang=\\\"EN-GB\\\" data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">.</span></span><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"> This will mean she will not be able to drop off and pick-up her children from school. The process of finding a job that works around her children has begun to negatively affect her mental health. </span> </p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"OutlineElement Ltr SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"Paragraph SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">In Tanya</span><span class=\\\"TextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\" lang=\\\"EN-GB\\\" data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">’</span></span><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">s case there are multiple compounding issues which are affecting her quality of life. In order to really change her circumstances, there are a few different things that would need to change – some of which are in Tanya’s control. For example, she may need to do some training so that she is able to access new employment opportunities which may be more flexible and pay better. Affordable and reliable transport could help Tanya access employment and/or training as well as make trips to help children's school quicker and easier. Good transport provision would also mean she could widen the area she is searching for jobs in. Where possible, more flexible behaviours from employers will also help more people engage with the labour market. These changes would help reduce her financial worries and could help with both her physical and mental health.</span> </p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"OutlineElement Ltr SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"Paragraph SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">In order to create a happy and healthy society where everyone can thrive</span><span class=\\\"TextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\" lang=\\\"EN-GB\\\" data-contrast=\\\"auto\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">,</span></span><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"> we could need to address all of the issues.

When addressing an issue in one policy area there is opportunity to create real change by looking beyond and at the whole system. Looking at the whole system creates more meaningful and comprehensive change that makes a real difference to people. </span> <span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"></span></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"OutlineElement Ltr SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"Paragraph SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\"><span class=\\\"NormalTextRun SCXW36860681 BCX0\\\">This is why we do not prioritise one fundamental over another.
