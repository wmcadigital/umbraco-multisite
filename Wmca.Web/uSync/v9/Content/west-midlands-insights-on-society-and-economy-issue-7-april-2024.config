This latest data underpins the focus of the West Midlands Innovation Board on two critical innovation areas for the region, our policy work with Government and the broadening of the innovation bandwidth within the region.</p>\\n<p>Business spend on research and development is a critical driver for the regional innovation ecosystem because it drives higher-value processes and products which contribute to regional economic growth with two associated benefits; first R&amp;D activity within the region significantly improves the chances of ‘sticky’ growth while second, the critical mass of R&amp;D creates spillover benefits as new technologies are applied to emerging challenges in different sectors.</p>\\n<p>Businesses in the ITL1 West Midlands region spent an estimated £3.8bn in 2022 on R&amp;D (or £637 per person living in our region). Over a similar timeframe, public spending of £0.7bn in our region means the West Midlands continues to have a high ratio of private to public investment (now 5.1:1). This confirms that the West Midlands remains remarkably efficient at using public investment to lever private activity - an important strategic reference point that myself, University Vice-Chancellors, and the Mayor highlight in the ongoing Strategic Innovation Partnership discussions with the Science Minister, our bilateral \\\"West Midlands Action Plan\\\" work with Innovate UK and we amplify to the world in the ‘Tech that Makes Tomorrow’ campaign. </p>\\n<p>The Innovation Board has already identified that the region’s business R&amp;D has historically been deep-but-narrow. We will continue to maintain our competitive advantage in automotive and aerospace technologies, but increasingly have championed efforts to stimulate new emerging clusters (Cleantech, Medtech/Health Tech, Creative Industries) by diversifying public and private R&amp;D through activities like the £33m Innovation Accelerator, the new West Midlands Investment Zone, and partnership with Plug and Play UK.</p>\\n<p>Mike Wright<br>Chair, West Midlands Innovation Board</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/documents/research-and-insights/wise-newsletter-april-2024/\\\">Read more in the April 2024 WISE newsletter</a><a href=\\\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/documents/research-and-insights/wise-newsletter-march-2024/\\\"></a>.</p>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"settingsData\": []\n}",
