<p>We currently have a total of 29 youngsters going through our Restorative Justice scheme at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>They are taking part in the scheme for various offences on the public transport network, from Grievous Bodily Harm and Anti Social Behaviour- to arson and criminal damage.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We have also issued 12 first stage warning letters to offenders for low level ASB on the network.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>This behaviour will not be tolerated on our network and our scheme has so far proven to be very successful.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>If passengers witness any ASB on public transport we encourage you to text 'bus' followed by a space to 83010, with a message giving as much information as possible about the nature of the incident.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyone witnessing criminal behaviour should ring 999 as they would do normally.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A dedicated Safer Travel Anti-Social Behaviour team investigates each report it receives.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rail and Midland Metro passenger should use the British Transport Police equivalent number- 61010.&nbsp;</div>                    </div>]]></Value>
