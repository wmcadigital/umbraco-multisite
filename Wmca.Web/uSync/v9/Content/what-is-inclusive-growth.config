You might know it as ‘community wealth building’ or creating a ‘Wellbeing Economy’ or the ‘Foundational Economy’ etc. There are several different approaches, each with a slightly different focus. However, all ensure people and place benefit from the model. We call it ‘inclusive growth’ at the WMCA. </p>\n<h2>Inclusive growth defined </h2>\n<p>We define inclusive growth as: </p>\n<p>‘A more deliberate and socially purposeful model of economic growth, measured not only by how fast or aggressive it is; but also, by how well it is created and shared across the whole population and place, and by the social and environmental outcomes it realises for our people.’ </p>\n<p>Put simply, we want everything that we do contribute to creating opportunities for all our citizens to live fulfilling lives and thrive while respecting the boundaries of our living planet. </p>\n<p>Our inclusive growth doughnut has eight themes that are fundamental to the West Midlands. </p>"

We call these our fundamentals of inclusive growth.  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>These fundamentals are: </li>\n<li>Climate resilience</li>\n<li>Affordable and safe places</li>\n<li>Education and learning </li>\n<li>Connected communities</li>\n<li>Health and wellbeing</li>\n<li>Power and participation</li>\n<li>Inclusive economy </li>\n<li>Equality </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The seven fundamentals you see in the centre of the ring are our people focused areas, making up the social foundation of the doughnut. The outer ring is our planetary boundaries. This is the upper limit for our planet and its ability to replenish itself.  Whatever we do should not exceed this. </p>\n<h2>What does inclusive growth look like? </h2>\n<p>Under each fundamental, we have a key goal or outcome that we are aiming to achieve along with our local partners, central government, businesses and communities. We’ll know that we’ve made a difference when things start to change for our people and planet.  </p>\n<p>These outcomes are: </p>\n<p>Climate resilience: Carbon emissions decoupled from economic growth and reduced to net zero by 2041 </p>\n<p>Affordable and safe places: Designing out homelessness in the West Midlands through prevention by design: ensuring a supply of affordable homes, tackling welfare related poverty, good employment, information, integrated prevention, advice and guidance </p>\n<p>Education and learning: improved levels of skills for all to flourish and realise their potential </p>\n<p>Connected communities: People live in connected communities which enable everyone to interact with the world around them, both physically and digitally. </p>\n<p>Health and wellbeing: avoidable differences in health outcomes are reduced so that everyone can live longer, healthier, and happier lives </p>\n<p>Inclusive economy: people experience an increase in their household incomes and a better standard of living </p>\n<p>Power and participation: people have the power and can fully participate in influencing and exercising agency in the things that matter to them </p>\n<p>Equality: reduced employment inequalities so that people have the opportunity to thrive and flourish regardless of their protected characteristics and backgrounds</p>"
