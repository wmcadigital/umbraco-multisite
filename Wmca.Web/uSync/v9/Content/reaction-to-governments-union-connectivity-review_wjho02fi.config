            <p><strong>Reacting to the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1036027/union-connectivity-review-final-report.pdf">Union Connectivity Review</a>, Maria Machancoses CEO of Midlands Connect, said:</strong></p>
<p>“It’s fantastic to see Government support vital infrastructure projects that will better connect the Midlands and Wales, improving access to leisure destinations, workplaces and key services. &nbsp;As well as welcoming further improvements in rail connectivity between Birmingham, the Black Country, Shropshire and Mid-Wales and Birmingham and Cardiff, the report also highlights the importance of strategic roads such as the A5 and Pant-Llanymynech bypass.”</p>
<p>“We will now work internally and alongside partners to ensure swift progress is made in planning these improvements, so that connectivity benefits can be felt by communities as soon as possible. If implemented, the projects listed in the Union Connectivity Review will mean that lives and livelihoods can prosper across administrative borders, and that people can reach the jobs, healthcare and education they need to succeed. These links will also benefit businesses, smoothing trade, access to employees and supply chains.”</p>
