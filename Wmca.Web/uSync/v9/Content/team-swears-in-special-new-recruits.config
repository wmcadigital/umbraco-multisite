<div><span>Travel on the West Midlands public transport network is now even safer with the recruitment of 12 new Special Constables.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>

<div><span>The volunteer officers have been jointly recruited by West Midlands Police and British Transport Police to join the Safer Travel team, which deals with crime and anti-social behaviour on public transport.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>They will be the first Specials to have a dedicated role in policing the region�s trains, buses and trams.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>The twelve recruits were sworn in as Special Constables at a ceremony at the Safer Travel Command Centre&nbsp;in Birmingham.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>The men and women hold down a variety of day jobs and include full-time students and bus drivers.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Inspector Lee Gordon, in charge of the Safer Travel Team, said: "I am delighted to welcome these new officers to the team.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Special Constables make a valuable contribution to local policing and provide an important link with the community.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>They will provide a visible reassurance for people using trains, trams and buses, help reduce crime and make passengers feel safe and secure."</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>The Safer Travel Police Team carries out regular reassurance and intelligence-led patrols on public transport and organises regular operations to target criminals who operate on the network.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Officers also work closely with youngsters about the importance of good behaviour.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Special Constables have the same powers as regular officers and wear the same uniform. Their hours are flexible but they are required to work a minimum of four hours each week.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>The recruitment honours an election commitment made by West Midlands Police &amp; Crime Commissioner Bob Jones to make public transport safer in the West Midlands by bolstering the force's pool of volunteer officers.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>He said: "I salute the Special Constables, they are remarkable people who serve the community and play a vital role in policing.</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>These new recruits are a fantastic addition to the Safer Travel Team."</span></div>                    </div>]]></Value>
