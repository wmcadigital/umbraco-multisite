<p>An eagle-eyed officer is showing no let-up in his razor-sharp instincts after spotting a record number of crime suspects in the last year.</p>
<p>PCSO Andy Pope is living up to his reputation as the ’memory man’ of West Midlands Police for remembering faces of wanted men and women.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His special talent led to 406 people being spotted in 2019 - a new record in a year - which included 16 in just one day.</p>
<p>Andy’s actions have led to arrests for offences ranging from attempted murder and thefts to sexual assaults and he is now closing in on recognising 2,000 suspects since 2012.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old has a knack of remembering faces he’s seen from CCTV, video stills and police briefings - and can recall faces weeks, months or even years later. Last year he recognised a man who had been wanted for two years over causing nuisance on train platforms across the Midlands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The super recogniser patrols the region’s transport hubs as part of the Safer Travel Partnership team but his impressive identification skills are often used to assist other departments.</p>
<p>Andy said: "I take great pride in being in a position to help the force catch criminals and protect the public.</p>
<p>"I’m fortunate faces stick in my memory and I always make sure I spend time looking at the most wanted briefings ahead of going out on duty.</p>
<p>"There are officers and staff across the force who do various roles to help keep the streets safe. I am just pleased I can contribute and hopefully there will be many more crime suspects I can spot in future."</p>
