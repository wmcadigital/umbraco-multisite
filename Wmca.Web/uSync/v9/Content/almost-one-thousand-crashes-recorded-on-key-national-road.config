      "richText": "<div class=\"summary\">\n<p>Nearly one thousand collisions on the A1 between Peterborough and Blyth were reported in an 8-year period, according to research from sub-national transport body Midlands Connect.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n<p>A whopping 968 incidents were recorded from 2015 to 2022, 36 of which were fatal. The majority of incidents were classed as ‘slight’ (753), the rest being classed as ‘severe’, with a wide variety of causes at play.</p>\n<p>During this period, there were almost 300 incidents where one or both carriageways of the A1 were closed, as a result of a crash or other incidents. Almost two-thirds of these (196) resulted in delays of over 15 minutes for drivers and took over five hours to clear.</p>\n<p>The number of collisions went down during the lockdown periods but has begun to creep up again more recently.</p>\n<p>The A1 is the longest numbered road in the UK, it connects London to Edinburgh, passing through the East Midlands. It is a key artery in the UK roads network.</p>\n<p><strong>Swati Mittal, Integrated Transport Programme Lead at Midlands Connect, said:</strong></p>\n<p>“The A1 is such an important road running through our part of the country.</p>\n<p>“These numbers show the need for improvements along this corridor, even though the statistics show a trend of decrease in accidents.</p>\n<p>“Even a small crash can have a big impact on someone’s life.</p>\n<p>“It is vital that work begins to reduce the number of collisions occurring here as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p>Improvements at the A1/A52 junction at Grantham have been identified as a priority upgrade by Midlands Connect and local councils. The interventions it is recommending will reduce the collision rates and safety concerns around the junction.</p>\n<p>The developments will support local growth as well as maintain the strategic performance of the A1 and A52 and maximise the benefits of the Grantham Southern Relief Road for the town.</p>\n<p>The partnership wants Government to award the project support as part of its third Road Investment Strategy (RIS3). If successful, this could mean that National Highways is given funding to deliver the improvements between 2025 to 2030.</p>\n</div>"
