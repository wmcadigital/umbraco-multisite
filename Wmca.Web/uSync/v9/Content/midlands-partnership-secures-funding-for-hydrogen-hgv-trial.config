            <p><strong>Innovate UK has secured funding from the Department for Transport to undertake a Hydrogen HGV trial, with support from Midlands Connect, Midlands Engine, the West Midlands Combined Authority, Nottingham City Council and others. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Following this announcement,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Head of Strategy at Midlands Connect&nbsp;</strong><strong>Richard Bradley said:</strong></p>
<p><span>“Th</span><span>e Midlands lies at the centre of the UK’s freight and logistics industries and it’s fantastic that it’s been selected as the location for these future trials examining the use of hydrogen-powered HGV trucks. The movement of goods has continued to grow across our region despite COVID-19 and action must be taken now to accelerate the roll out of alternative fuels such as hydrogen, to make the industry greener, less polluting and more sustainable. Midlands Connect is looking forward to working with other organisations across the project consortium by providing analysis to predict vehicle movements and the best locations for hydrogen refuelling stations.”</span></p>
