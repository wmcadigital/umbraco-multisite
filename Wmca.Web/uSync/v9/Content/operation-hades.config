<p>Operation Hades took place between the 27<sup>th</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>February and the 2<sup>nd</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>March at West Bromwich tram stop to coincide with the opening of the new Sandwell College campus.</p>
<p>The operation focussed on revenue protection, passenger reassurance and anti social behaviour, and involved additional bus and Metro staff from National Express West Midlands working with Police officers and PCSO’s from the Safer Travel Police Team.</p>
<p>It provided a good opportunity to raise awareness among college students and staff about crime reduction and Safer Travel issues on buses and trams, and to promote the 'See Something Say Something' Initiative.&nbsp;One person was arrested during the week in relation to possession and use of a fraudulent pass, and a number of people were issued penalty fares in relation to ticketless travel and using out of date passes.</p>                    </div>]]></Value>
