Price (76%) and anxiety about battery range (55%) were also issues highlighted by respondents.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The research also revealed 97% of people who do not yet own an EV would be willing to travel up to five miles to access a charging point for their EV, yet just under half (44%) were not confident they could find a public EV charging point within this distance.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just under two-thirds (62%) of those who already own an EV think there are not enough public charge points available for use. A majority of 80% of EV users reported feeling worried they were low on battery charge and not close to an EV charging station and 79% have had to take a detour on a journey to find a charging point; of these, 18% of detours were more than five miles long.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The research has been published ahead of Midlands Connect’s EV Conference, taking place virtually on 7 March 2023. The conference will <span class=\"normaltextrun\">bring together senior leaders and policymakers to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the Electric Vehicle industry.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span class=\"normaltextrun\">Maria Machancoses, CEO of Midlands Connect, commented:</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"normaltextrun\">“Our research shows the lack of charge points is a barrier for those who do not own an EV, and we know there is a need to increase EV charger roll-out across the Midlands. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"normaltextrun\">“We also want to make sure people who have already chosen to purchase an EV are having the best experience possible and will continue to choose EVs over polluting petrol and diesel vehicles in the future. However, many have experienced anxiety due to a lack of charge points or have had to make a detour due to a lack of charge points in their area. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color: black;\">“Choosing to purchase an EV needs to be a more attractive option for consumers if we are to reduce harmful emissions and tackle climate change. One way we can tackle this is to increase the roll-out of EV chargers across the region.”</span></p>"
