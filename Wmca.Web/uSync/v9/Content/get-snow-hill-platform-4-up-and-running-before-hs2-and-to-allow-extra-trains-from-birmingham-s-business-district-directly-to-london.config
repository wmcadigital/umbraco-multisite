            <p>The focus will be on reinstating platform 4 at Snow Hill before HS2 is completed in Birmingham. This will allow for additional trains directly from Birmingham’s business district into London.</p>
<p>Research recently conducted by Mott MacDonald for Midlands Connect shows that footfall at Snow Hill station would increase by 127,000 per annum if platform 4 is reinstated, including more than 14,000 new trips a year.</p>
<p><strong>Midlands Connect’s Senior Rail Programme Manager, Andy Clark, commented on the visit:</strong></p>
<p><em>“It’s great that Tan is coming to Birmingham to show his support for our schemes. The reinstating of Platform 4 could benefit so many workers in Birmingham and London; so, it’s essential we get it up and running.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Tan Dhesi, MP for Slough, and Shadow Rail Minister, said:</strong></p>
<p><em>“It's fantastic to be here in Birmingham to discuss the Midlands Rail Hub and the reopening of Platform 4 at Snow Hill with Midlands Connect and colleagues. </em></p>
<p><em>“The plans they have for rail are important to connect local communities, ensuring rail is convenient and accessible for all.”</em></p>
<p>Mr Dhesi will be taking part in a roundtable meeting with stakeholders about the Midlands Rail Hub. Reopening platform 4 of Snow Hill is one ‘quick win’ of the Midlands Rail Hub which could have a very short turnaround. Another intervention will be two new railway routes into Birmingham Moor Street.</p>
<p>Later this year, Midlands Connect will be launching the Outline Business Case for the Midlands Rail Hub. This will delineate how the MRH can be built — what the expected delivery times, costs, and benefits will be. If work on the MRH starts in 2025, the scheme could be completed by 2030.</p>
