The airport has plans to increase passenger numbers to 18 million by 2033, and it sits close to nationally important assets like the National Exhibition Centre (NEC), Resorts World and Jaguar Land Rover's Solihull plant.<br><br>Our rail improvement plans ensure better access to the area on the conventional network, utilising the extra network capacity released by HS2, as well as double tracking sections of the route south of the airport.<br><br>These factors, alongside modest timetable changes will improve connections to Coventry and Birmingham Airport from the south of England, East Midlands, Yorkshire and the North East; increasing the frequency of services from Leamington, Banbury, Oxford and Reading from one to two trains per hour and opening up new direct paths to and from Derby, Sheffield, Doncaster, York, Darlington, Durham and Newcastle.<br><br>This will increase the attractiveness of flights from Birmingham Airport to a host of new passengers, and bring hundreds of thousands of people closer to leisure, business and tourism destinations via public transport. It will also open up capacity on the Birmingham to Solihull rail corridor.<br><br><strong>Delivery:</strong> in line with HS2<br><br><strong>New direct services:</strong> to Coventry &amp; Birmingham International from Derby, Sheffield, York and Newcastle.</p>"
