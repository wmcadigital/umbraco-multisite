            <p>One question. And one that doesn’t have any easy answers! It requires a firm grasp of how goods move now; but we also need to look to the future to understand the factors that will affect our economy in the coming decades and what the impact of this will be, so we can begin to work towards a transport infrastructure that will meet those needs.</p>
<p>It’s the question at the heart of our Economy and Freight Programme, and why we want to speak to businesses across the region over the next couple of months. We’re already working on the data, identifying how we can work with others to address gaps and bring areas up to date. We’ve also begun the thinking on a future network for alternative refuelling and recharging.</p>
<p>But we know that the knowledge and experience of those who work across the key economic clusters and supply chains in the Midlands, from logistics through to the major generators of goods movements, is key to answering this question as well as possible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next couple of months, we want to interview as many businesses as possible (our contact details are at the end) or gain your views through <a href="https://ddec1-0-en-ctp.trendmicro.com/wis/clicktime/v1/query?url=https%3a%2f%2fforms.office.com%2fPages%2fResponsePage.aspx%3fid%3dVnZLlU9zhkmqyFJGDu7q5z3X6AxXjSNPhaZT0PlJuU1UREdBOVpSMExIWTVSUFRQQUFBVDAyV0ZXWi4u&amp;umid=c2ce3033-8eb7-4ecd-8765-84713b03c17e&amp;auth=0cdf0a686ae810bda994ce6c467eae3a8395b7e5-6b5e14499561325b3b1ebb097d56009432d6a504">our survey</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that the economy in the Midlands is already strong, but we also know that there are plenty of opportunities for growth that many wish to build upon. The sector in the UK is already strong, coming 9<sup>th</sup> in the World Economic Forum’s global rankings for competitiveness in 2020.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t leave space for complacency. The sector has altered over recent years with changing shopping habits and import and export requirements. Many businesses are also beginning to address questions on a range of issues about how vehicle fleets will be powered in the future and their affordability, through to the opportunities that AI and digitisation can bring to businesses, and whether supply chains need greater resilience to both support the regional economy and protect against some of the external shocks we experienced in recent years. In addition, sectors need the access to people and skills to futureproof operations.</p>
<p>Our role at Midlands Connect is to understand how these developments will influence the transport infrastructure of the future, where we need to encourage policy change and support the work of others in the sector.</p>
<p>We look forward to talking to and hearing from the sector over the coming months. We hope that this will be the start of an ongoing relationship with industry that allows us to work towards greater regional prosperity.</p>
