            <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">The Midlands Rail Hub is the region’s biggest and most ambitious rail improvement scheme - a £1.5bn blueprint for faster, better and more frequent connections across the Midlands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Under the plans, one additional train per hour will run between Hereford and Birmingham Moor Street, passing through Worcester. This will be 10 minutes faster than the current service, thanks to faster routing into Birmingham. The new train service to Hereford will provide around two million additional seats to and from Birmingham each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Jesse Norman, MP for Hereford, said:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">“As the local MP, I want railways and public transport to be as accessible and efficient as possible. Midlands Rail Hub will serve the people of Hereford and contribute to this goal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Karen Heppenstall, Head of Rail at Midlands Connect commented:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">“It’s great to come to Hereford to promote the Midlands Rail Hub. The proposals will benefit residents of both Hereford and broader Herefordshire. I’m glad we have the support of local politicians and enterprise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Last year Midlands Connect submitted an Outline Business Case for the Midlands Rail Hub to government, asking for funding to develop a Full Business Case and get building works started by 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Karen and Jesse were joined by Clive Brooks, Herefordshire and Worcestershire Chambers of Commerce; Sonia Roberts, Marches LEP; and Cllr John Harrington.</span></p>
