<p>Despite having a combined population of over one million residents, the three major cities of Coventry, Leicester and Nottingham, are not directly connected by rail. This deficiency means that at present, fewer than 3% of journeys along this busy corridor are made by rail. This event will outline a new business case to reinstate direct services between these economic centres, the impacts of doing so, and the steps needed to bring these plans into fruition. Rail must play an integral role in accelerating our journey to a sustainable future; research suggests that even if all new cars are ULEVs by 2035, a 58% reduction in car mileage is needed for car CO2 emissions to be in line with the Paris Agreement.</p>
