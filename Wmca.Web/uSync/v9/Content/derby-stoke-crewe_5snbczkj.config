Doing so could provide an alternative to the congested A50 and M6.<br><br>It could also be possible to reduce journey times by 20 minutes with changes to calling patterns on this additional service.<br><br>Investing in this corridor can also improve links to HS2 services at Crewe for people in north Staffordshire and the East Midlands.<br><br>The new franchise holder Abellio is already proposing an extension to services on this corridor to Nottingham, which will be included in our own corridor study.<br><br><strong>Delivery</strong>: In phases from 2022 to 2033, with an estimated capital cost of less than £50 million.<br><br><strong>Journey time saving</strong>: 79 min to 55 min.<br><br><strong>Passenger demand:</strong> 72% increase by 2037 following improvements.</p>\n<h3>What happens next?</h3>\n<p>A feasibility study is underway and a Strategic Outline Business Case is due to be submitted in 2020.</p>"
