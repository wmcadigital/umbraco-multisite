            "textbox": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Last week, the WMCA and Aston University welcomed visitors from Germany to a special conference on Levelling Up. Almost exactly two years since the Levelling Up White Paper was first published, it was a timely opportunity to reflect on progress from the perspectives of two countries who have taken very different approaches to regional development, with very different results.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the time of German reunification, the disparities between East and West were vast, but thanks to highly proactive regional policy, in the past three decades regions like Saxony and Brandenburg have significantly narrowed gaps in productivity, wages and wider wellbeing. Now, former East German regions are easily outperforming most English regions outside London, including the West Midlands as shown in the graph below. The conference gave us the opportunity to understand how this has happened.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<figure><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/{localLink:umb://media/68ca105db0be477f93bd203906b6f95a}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Levelling Up Lessons From Germany\"><img src=\"?rmode=max&amp;width=500\" alt=\"Graphic that showsline graph showing the gross domestic product per capita for West Midlands Combined Authority area (ITL2) vs the states of the former East Germany (with, and without Berlin) - showing that GDP per capita in East Germany as a whole, including Berlin, overtook WMCA in 2011; and GDP per capita in East Germany (excluding Berlin) overtook WMCA in 2020.\" width=\"500\" height=\"327\" data-udi=\"umb://media/68ca105db0be477f93bd203906b6f95a\" data-caption=\"Line graph showing the gross domestic product per capita for West Midlands Combined Authority area (ITL2) vs the states of the former East Germany (with, and without Berlin) - showing that GDP per capita in East Germany as a whole, including Berlin, overtook WMCA in 2011; and GDP per capita in East Germany (excluding Berlin) overtook WMCA in 2020.\"></a>\n<figcaption>Line graph showing the gross domestic product per capita for West Midlands Combined Authority area (ITL2) vs the states of the former East Germany (with, and without Berlin) - showing that GDP per capita in East Germany as a whole, including Berlin, overtook WMCA in 2011; and GDP per capita in East Germany (excluding Berlin) overtook WMCA in 2020</figcaption>\n</figure>"

            "textbox": "<p>It is hard to underestimate the scale of investment that has gone into German regional policy. Our conference was addressed by Carsten Schneider MdB, Parliamentary State Secretary for East Germany and Equivalent Living Conditions, who told us about the €40bn package set aside to compensate German regions for the closure of coal-fired power stations and invest in R&amp;D centres in affected regions, the expansion of motorway and railway links, and the construction of landmark sites such as a sports arena for international competitions in Leipzig.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crucially, this investment is not controlled by central diktat - neither is it governed by narrow ‘Green Book’-style appraisal. As Schneider told the conference: “our regional governments know best what is needed in their areas, provided they don’t suggest something crazy, we don’t interfere”.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This was by no means the only way in which a more devolved approach to regional development seemed to be essential to how Germany has levelled-up. In Germany - <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/tax-and-devolution\">as with so many other developed nations</a> - there is significant financial autonomy for German regional government through so-called fiscal devolution. German lander typically generate c.35% of their revenues through regional and local taxation. By contrast, in England this is just 5% leaving English local government and Combined Authorities almost entirely dependent on central government grants.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, any such system of regional fiscal devolution requires some level of equalisation between regions to ensure the ability to level-up between richer and poorer states. Ever since Germany’s postwar settlement, the notion of <em>Länderfinanzausgleich</em> (regional fiscal equalisation) with a view to ‘Equal Living Conditions’ has been a tenet of the national constitution. Most citizens of the affluent Bavaria, for example, have seen it as a matter of national duty to pay a premium on their tax bill to contribute to regional reconstruction in the East.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When we quizzed our German counterparts on how such an approach could guarantee to maximise the return on investment of tax-payers’ money – the central premise of HMT’s Green Book methodology - they admonished what they described would be considered an “ideological” use of public money. It seems one country’s orthodoxy is another’s ideology - and vice versa.<!-- [if !supportAnnotations]--></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, our German visitors were quick to disabuse us of the idea that all was rosy for German regional policy, indeed there are very topical debates about the fairness and success of Länderfinanzausgleich and related fiscal measures. There will also be those who quite rightly suggest that <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2023/01/the-truth-about-germanys-levelling-up/\">our national histories and cultures are just too different</a> to expect that there could be anything we could possibly translate into the UK context. But listening to colleagues from North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony discuss the ways they have approached regional development through industrial transition - and recognising their relative success in comparison to the West Midlands - two simple conclusions can still be readily drawn.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Firstly, even a small modicum of fiscal decentralisation is surely an experiment worth trying in English combined authorities. The new West Midlands and Greater Manchester ‘Single Settlements’ will be a start, but we are going to have to go further and faster and to <a href=\"https://sites.harvard.edu/uk-regional-growth/2024/02/25/new-release-a-growth-policy-to-close-britains-regional-divides-what-needs-to-be-done/\">question Green Book orthodoxies</a> if we are ever to turn the tide on regional inequality in England.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And secondly, we are inundated with <a href=\"https://economy2030.resolutionfoundation.org/reports/a-tale-of-two-cities-part-1/\">reports on levelling-up</a> where the basic proposition is that if region’s outside London simply replicated the capital city’s recipe for success then all would be well. Such thought experiments are methodologically questionable and economically naïve. How much more there is to learn from European comparator regions that share a similar economic history and offer far more relevant pathways to success? We learned a lot through this initial pan-European collaboration and we look forward to learning even more as our relationships develop further.<!-- [if !supportAnnotations]--></p>\n<div style=\"mso-element: comment-list;\"><hr class=\"msocomoff\"><!--[endif]-->\n<div style=\"mso-element: comment;\"><!-- [if !supportAnnotations]--></div>\n<div style=\"mso-element: comment;\">\n<div id=\"_com_2\" class=\"msocomtxt\">\n<p class=\"MsoCommentText\"> </p>\n<!-- [if !supportAnnotations]--></div>\n<!--[endif]--></div>\n</div>"
