            <p><strong>In response to today's announcement that Phase 2a of HS2 from Birmingham to Crewe has reached Royal Assent, Maria Machancoses, director of Midlands Connect, said:</strong></p>
<p>“Today’s historic milestone will be music to the ears of businesses, investors and travellers alike. It’s heartening to see progress being made, Government must now work to ensure this momentum is maintained and that construction is started on the Birmingham to Crewe leg as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“While Phases One and 2a are moving ahead apace, and have created thousands of highly-skilled jobs, apprenticeships and unprecedented regeneration, it is essential that an decision is made on the scope of Phase 2b of the project, especially the Eastern Leg of the route between Birmingham, the East Midlands, Chesterfield, Sheffield and Leeds. Any further delay will cause uncertainty at a time where business confidence and job security have been shaken by COVID-19. We in the Midlands and North are clear, we need the whole of the HS2 network to be delivered, in full.”</p>
