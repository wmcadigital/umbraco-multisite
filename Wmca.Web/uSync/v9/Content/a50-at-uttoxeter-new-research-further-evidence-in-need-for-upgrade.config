<p><strong>New research by transport body Midlands Connect shows that cars are going as slow as 14 miles-per-hour at a vital pinch point in Uttoxeter.</strong></p>
<p>New data released today by Midlands Connect shows that cars are going as slow as 14 miles-per-hour has been dubbed as ‘further evidence’ for the need to upgrade the A50 in and around Uttoxeter.</p>
<p>The figures show that during the week drivers at peak time are driving as slow as 14 miles-per-hour between the A522 Beamhurst junction and the McDonald’s island in Uttoxeter. This is one of the key junctions that Midlands Connect and Staffordshire County Council are proposing to government are improved in the upcoming Road Investment Strategy for 2025 to 2030.</p>
<p>On weekdays in 2023 so far, between 7 and 8am the speed is between 14 and 20 miles-per hour whereas on a Sunday cars are passing between the junctions on average up to 65 miles-per hour. These delays are costing the economy with Midlands Connect estimating that delays along the A50 corridor are costing £8m each year in lost time alone. The upgrades also have widespread support from local residents not just in Uttoxeter but also throughout Staffordshire.</p>
<p>In 2022 Midlands Connect released a ‘road map’ document with a series of proposals for the A50/A500 which outlined how improvements in the route could add £12 billion to the region's economy over the next 60 years, help to unlock more than 12,000 jobs and reduce journey times by 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on the analysis, Maria Machancoses CEO of Midlands Connect said:</strong></p>
<p>“Of course vehicles will go slower at busier times but these figures are stark and are further evidence as to why we need to upgrade the A50, the A500 and this roundabout in Uttoxeter specifically. We need to unlock the massive growth potential in the area and allow residents, businesses and commuters to get from A to B quicker and speedier.</p>
<p>“The benefits for the economy in terms of jobs and growth are clear and Midlands Connect is working with Staffordshire County Council and Kate Kniveton MP and others to make the case for investment.”</p>
<p><strong>Commenting, Project Champion for the North Midlands Manufacturing Corridor, Kate Kniveton MP said:</strong></p>
<p>“The A50 is a vital trunk road for the midlands and our regional economy, connecting some of our biggest conurbations and employers. My residents in Uttoxeter know only too well how issues with the current A50 have a knock-on impact on the historic market town and their daily commutes.</p>
<p>“The newly published data from Midland Connect starkly highlights the issues with the A50 and how the current carriageway layout contributes to congestion, affecting hundreds of thousands of drivers each year. It is also the case that idling traffic with frequent accelerations and decelerations will produce more emissions and increase levels of air pollution locally.</p>
<p>“RIS3 is such a critical opportunity we are all working towards to secure the necessary funding and infrastructure improvements to the A50, cutting congestion and unlocking the untapped benefits these road upgrades would have on our regional economy.”</p>
<p><strong>Commenting further, Councillor Philip White, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Economy and Skills added:</strong></p>
<p>“Securing improvements to the A50/A500 corridor is one of our key priorities as a county council and we are working in partnership with Midlands Connect and other stakeholders to make our case to Government for this much needed investment.</p>
<p>“We know that congestion and delays restrict growth, add costs to businesses and disrupts people’s journeys.</p>
<p>“The A50/A500 corridor is vital for east-west connectivity, important not just to ours and neighbouring counties but to the UK economy.”</p>
