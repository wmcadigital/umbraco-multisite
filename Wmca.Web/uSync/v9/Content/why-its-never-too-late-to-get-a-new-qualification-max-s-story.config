I’m 39-years-old and was genuinely worried about my next move – I’ve got a family to support and bills to pay.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">\\\"Last year, I went to a jobs fair at my local job centre in Wolverhampton. I must admit I didn’t hold much hope, but I was very wrong!</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">\\\"A chance encounter with Michelle from In-Comm Training changed my life. She told me about an opportunity to enrol on a six-month advanced engineering course with Collins Aerospace through In-Comm Training.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">\\\"I was intrigued, I’d applied to work at Collins before but was unsuccessful. I thought to myself this is a fantastic opportunity to get a qualification and ultimately a career. I did want to go straight into work and earn money, but I’ve had to stay on benefits for six months while doing the course.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">\\\"At first, I thought I’ve bitten off a bit more than I can chew as it’s a Level 3 NVQ in engineering, but the tutors at In-Comm have made it easier for me. I’ve even finished my assessments ahead of time! It’s graft but at the end of the six months I know I will get a career in engineering.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">\\\"The course has changed my life phenomenally. I feel so much more confident about the future. I’ve got a family and it’s a case of working for them. To me it’s about showing them daddy goes out to work and this is what you fundamentally do when you grow up.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">\\\"My son asks how was my school because he knows I’m at training college and not actually at work. My family are proud of me, they know it’s going to be beneficial in the long run.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">\\\"I’m 40 this year and this is just the start. Who knows where this qualification can take me.\\\"</p>\\n<h4 class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><strong>Inspired by Max? <a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/what-we-do/employment-and-skills/explore-a-range-of-funded-courses-near-you/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Explore a range of funded courses near you. </a></strong></h4>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"settingsData\": []\n}",
