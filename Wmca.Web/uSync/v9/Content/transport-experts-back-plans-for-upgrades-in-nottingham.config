            <p>The event organised by Midlands Connect in partnership with Nottingham City Council will see discussions of proposed improvements to rail links in and out of the city, and a presentation of innovative transport developments.</p>
<p>The Nottingham Transport Summit will also focus on innovative transport in the city, with presentation and a panel from key figures in Nottingham City Council’s transport department. Nottingham is ahead of the game when it comes to innovative transport, with £11m of investment for electric buses being announced last year. The city has also invested in active travel such as e-bikes and e-scooters.</p>
<p>Midlands Connect will present an update on its proposals for rail improvements to Nottingham. One of these is the Nottingham to Lincoln line, passing through Newark Castle. The sub-national transport body is working on plans which would improve safety measures and reduce journey time.</p>
<p>Tawhida Yaacoub, Senior Rail Programme Manager at Midlands Connect commented:</p>
<p>“It’s great to be here in Nottingham today sharing our plans to improve connectivity to the city.</p>
<p>"Nottingham is such an important and key city in our patch so we want to showcase how we can help its residents keep moving.”</p>
<p>Cllr Audra Wynter, Portfolio holder for Transport at Nottingham City Council added:</p>
<p>“Both Nottingham City Council and Midlands Connect have such exciting plans for enhancing transport options in Nottingham. It is fantastic to come together and share these ideas with members of the community.”</p>
