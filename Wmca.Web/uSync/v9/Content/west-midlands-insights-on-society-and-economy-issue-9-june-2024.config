Damp and mould, and their detrimental impacts on health and wellbeing, are part of the critical issue of poor-quality housing.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">In 2023 the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) secured nearly £15 million from the Social Housing Quality Fund (SHQF) to tackle severe damp and mould in social housing properties across the region. The Centre for the New Midlands (CNM) has been commissioned to evaluate the range, scope and scale of organisational and tenant impacts of this funding programme.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">We are determined, as a think tank, to work collaboratively with stakeholders and communities to produce rigorous research with, and for, our region. Our recent co-design workshops have been invaluable in helping refine and improve our research tools like our tenant survey and interview protocols.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">These sessions, attended by tenants with lived experience of severe damp and mould, academics, health practitioners, charity and civic organisations, have revealed how the topic of damp and mould provides a frame for a plethora of interconnected issues such as:</p>\\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\\\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\\\"><span style=\\\"mso-list: Ignore;\\\">·<span style=\\\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\\\">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->the competing demands between developing new homes and improving the quality of existing older stock;</p>\\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\\\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\\\"><span style=\\\"mso-list: Ignore;\\\">·<span style=\\\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\\\">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->the importance of trust and communication between landlords and tenants in both gaining access to undertake repairs and understanding how to live with the new technologies and interventions in their homes;</p>\\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\\\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\\\"><span style=\\\"mso-list: Ignore;\\\">·<span style=\\\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\\\">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->the inextricable link between housing, health and wellbeing, and the cost of living;</p>\\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\\\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\\\"><span style=\\\"mso-list: Ignore;\\\">·<span style=\\\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\\\">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->the overlap between damp and mould interventions and retrofitting homes in the transition to net zero housing.</p>\\n<div style=\\\"mso-element: para-border-div; border: none; border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm;\\\">\\n<p style=\\\"border: none; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm;\\\" class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">We need to make the environmental, the social impact and the economic case for improving our housing stock.
