            <p><strong>Regional transport chiefs met with councillors and local leaders to discuss improvements in and around Stoke-on-Trent. According to specially commissioned consumer research by Midlands Connect, 87% of local residents are supportive of the £86 million package of upgrades throughout the city centre, which will work to boost connectivity and reduce traffic congestion. </strong></p>
<p>Attending the meeting were Jack Brereton MP and the leader of Stoke-on-Trent City Council Abi Brown, as well as key representatives from local businesses and industry.</p>
<p>The proposed City East Link Road scheme will create a new route to the south east of Hanley, with junction improvements, between the A52 Leek Road and A5272 Dividy Road, as well as a southwards spur to Eaton Park housing estate and Fenton Park industrial estate.</p>
<p>Existing routes such as the A50, A52, A5008 and A5272 suffer from significant congestion and delays. This new route will relieve congestion at critical pinch points, particularly where the A50 meets the A500. Journeys on the A50 can take three times longer than expected at peak times, with average speeds below 40mph.</p>
<p>This scheme would support the A50 between Meir Interchange and Sideway Junction (A50/A500) and the A500 between Sideway and City Road, by providing a more reliable diversion route during incidents and roadworks on the A50 and A500.</p>
<p>The new link road will bring significant reductions in bus journey times using the Bucknall Road corridor, as other vehicles divert to the new link road. New footpaths and dedicated cycle facilities will also be integrated, creating a direct link to the city centre from employment and residential areas to the south and east of the city.</p>
<p>Consumer research of almost 300 Stoke-on-Trent residents was carried out by Midlands Connect, in order to coincide with this roundtable discussion. An overwhelming 87% majority of the 251 locals interviewed were positive about the proposed link road.</p>
<p><strong>Commenting after the roundtable, Councillor Abi Brown said: </strong></p>
<p>“There has never been a better time to invest in Stoke-on-Trent and the Potteries. Our economy is at the forefront of innovation, spanning industries from advanced manufacturing and professional services, to life sciences.</p>
<p>“We are spearheading the green revolution as the country commits to a carbon neutral future.</p>
<p>“Stoke-on-Trent, the Potteries and Staffordshire, more so than any other region, relies on resilient transport networks to prosper and that is why it is so critical to bring everyone around the table, to hear progress on this vital project and keep everyone informed.”</p>
