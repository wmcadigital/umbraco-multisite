Their main goal is to ensure that everyone in the UK can have a high quality of life. They make decisions on behalf of their area because they know its’ needs best. </p>\\n<h3>How many combined authorities are there in the UK? </h3>\\n<p>Would you like to get to know all the combined authorities that exist so far? Currently, there are 11 in the UK: </p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>West Midlands Combined Authority  </li>\\n<li>Greater Manchester Combined Authority  </li>\\n<li>Liverpool City Region Combined Authority  </li>\\n<li>Tees Valley Combined Authority  </li>\\n<li>South Yorkshire Combined Authority  </li>\\n<li>Cambridgeshire and Peterborough </li>\\n<li>West of England  </li>\\n<li>West Yorkshire </li>\\n<li>York and North Yorkshire (new for 2024) </li>\\n<li>East Midlands (new for 2024) </li>\\n<li>North East Combined Authority  (new for 2024) – North of Tyne expanded </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>West Midlands and Greater Manchester are known as ‘trailblazer’ combined authorities because they are paving the way and experimenting with new ways of working and new projects to deliver. </p>\\n<p>There are more combined authorities on the horizon too. Look out for these in 2025: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Norfolk </li>\\n<li>Suffolk </li>\\n<li>Greater Lincolnshire </li>\\n<li>Hull </li>\\n<li>East Yorkshire </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Who makes decisions at combined authorities?  </h3>\\n<p>Most combined authorities have a mayor who is in charge. These mayors were elected by the community. All the local councils in the area vote on big decisions. </p>\\n<p>For example, in the West Midlands we have seven local councils:  </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Birmingham </li>\\n<li>Solihull </li>\\n<li>Sandwell </li>\\n<li>Wolverhampton </li>\\n<li>Walsall </li>\\n<li>Coventry </li>\\n<li>Dudley </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Is a Combined Authority the same as a council? </h3>\\n<p>It can be easy to get us mixed up with your local council. But we are different. </p>\\n<p>Councils deliver vital local services like:: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Emptying your bins </li>\\n<li>Filling potholes </li>\\n<li>Cutting the grass in your local park  </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>So, what does the West Midlands Combined Authority do? </h3>\\n<p>We make the West Midlands a better place to live and work by leading on projects that are better co-ordinated at scale over a regional level. </p>\\n<p>We’ve billions of pounds of investment for our region since we were set up in 2017, and here’s how we are using it: </p>\\n<p>Being better connected by:  </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Improving public transport </li>\\n<li>Building new bus lanes </li>\\n<li>New railway stations </li>\\n<li>Sorting problems with traffic </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Being greener and healthier by: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Improving the environment </li>\\n<li>Aiming to reduce carbon emissions to zero </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Being fairer and more prosperous by: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Regenerating derelict land so affordable homes can be built </li>\\n<li>Helping people get qualifications at all ages (joining forces with colleges/universities) </li>\\n<li>Supporting people to get better, well-paid jobs </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>How are Combined Authorities funded? </h3>\\n<p>Our funding comes in several main pots at the moment in the West Midlands. A lot of it comes from adult education funding and the transport levy. It also comes from membership fees from local councils.</p>\\n<p>But after a new deal we made with government in 2023, we will soon be treated like a government department with one pot of money, giving us more flexibility to plan and deliver our projects. </p>\\n<p>This will allow us to continue making the West Midlands the best region in the UK to work in, live in and visit for the years to come. </p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"/what-we-do\\\" title=\\\"What we do\\\" class=\\\"wmcads-btn wmcads-btn--primary\\\">Find out more about what we do</a></p>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"settingsData\": []\n}",
