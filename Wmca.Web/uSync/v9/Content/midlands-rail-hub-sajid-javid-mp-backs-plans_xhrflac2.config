            <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Midlands Rail Hub is an ambitious £1.5bn rail scheme set to transform rail travel across the whole of the Midlands. It includes improved access from the West Midlands to the South West, Wales, and the East Midlands.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Two stations in Mr Javid’s constituency, Bromsgrove and Barnt Green, could benefit from the proposals. Bromsgrove would see an additional train per hour to Birmingham Moor Street and Hereford, as well as the capacity for an additional Cross City service to Birmingham New Street and beyond. Barnt Green would also benefit from an additional Cross City service to and from Redditch, which the Midlands Rail Hub provides capacity for.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">These enhancements would be achieved through a package of improvements between Kings Norton and Barnt Green that includes the extension and upgrade of the current freight loop lines, infill electrification and an improved junction at Barnt Green. In addition, major new infrastructure is required in and around Birmingham City Centre.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">When he was Chancellor, Mr Javid granted £20m to Midlands Connect to fund the Outline Business Case. He commented:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">“I was delighted to meet with representatives from Midlands Connect to discuss their Midlands Rail Hub project. As Chancellor in 2019, I committed the Conservative Party to supporting this scheme and I look forward to seeing the fantastic benefits that it will bring to Bromsgrove District upon completion”</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Maria Machancoses, CEO of Midlands Connect, added:</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;"></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">“The fully delivery of Midlands Rail Hub will provide the region with more than 14 million more seats on the rail network each year and provide faster, more frequent or new rail links to key locations including Bromsgrove and Barnt Green, so it is fantastic that we have the support of the local MP.”</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #565656;">Last year Midlands Connect submitted an Outline Business Case for the Midlands Rail Hub to government, asking for funding to develop a Full Business Case and get building works started by 2025.</span></p>
