Time passes by and you feel like progression is the only logical way that you’ll feel satisfied with work again – not to mention, earning a little more money might be nice. </p>\\n<p>So, how do you go after it?</p>\\n<p>Sometimes, if you’re lucky, progression in a job role can happen naturally – but often you can end up chasing that promotion and time after time being pipped to the post.</p>\\n<p>We’re here to tell you that you can do it – that promotion is yours for the taking, and we’ve put together 6 tips that could help you grab it with both hands.</p>\\n<h4 class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><strong>Get skilled and grab that promotion – explore our <a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/what-we-do/employment-and-skills/explore-a-range-of-funded-courses-near-you/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><u>course finder</u></a> today.</strong></h4>\\n<p><strong>1. Ready, skill set, go</strong></p>\\n<p>Possibly one of the most effective ways to get that promotion, is to be the best qualified for it. </p>\\n<p>Thankfully, we’ve got you covered when it comes to getting the right skills for the job.</p>\\n<p>Just ask Kaya from the Black Country; he saw the growing demand for employees with digital skills, particularly in relation to AI, and he jumped at the chance to take on one of the courses we fund.</p>\\n<p>On developing his skills with the ‘AI for Current Workforce’ course, provided by Netcom, Kaya says: “Rather than fighting against the AI change, which is going to happen, I thought why not go with it and up-skill to futureproof myself. I think it will change my working life.” </p>\\n<p>So if, like Kaya, you can be prepared to meet employer’s ever-evolving needs for new skill sets, then you’re likely to be a shoe in for that next big promotion. </p>\\n<p><strong>2. Self-development is key</strong></p>\\n<p>Naturally, you’re likely to get better at your job the longer you’re doing it for – but desire for development shouldn’t just stop at the inevitable repetition of your daily 9 to 5.</p>\\n<p>Up-skilling with a funded course could be a great opportunity to, as Kaya puts it, “enhance your workflow” and show self-development to really impress.</p>\\n<p>Being willing to develop yourself in all aspects is a real asset. Whether that be taking on a course to grow your skill set, going the extra mile to improve a piece of work, or simply taking the time to research and expand your knowledge.</p>\\n<p>And if you’re not sure – ask! </p>\\n<p>All too often, asking questions is seen as a sign of weakness; but it’s quite the opposite. Asking questions is a sign that you care about your role and are keen to learn and develop.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Pitch in</strong></p>\\n<p>We all know that feeling when you have a burning, epic idea just waiting to take the meeting by storm, and then you… never actually share it.</p>\\n<p>Yeah, you really should share it.</p>\\n<p>Taking on a funded course can increase your knowledge and help you to feel confident pitching more impactful ideas. </p>\\n<p>What’s more, continuing to learn and explore new concepts could provide you with an edge over other candidates for that promotion. </p>\\n<p>Kaya will use what he’s learning on the ‘AI for Current Workforce’ course to form exciting new ideas in his wok as a VFX (Video Effects) Compositor. </p>\\n<p>He says: “There have been recent developments, so we’ve been learning about different types of AI and I think it’s a massive opportunity.”</p>\\n<p>Remember though: there’s no ‘I’ in ‘team’ – it’s all about working collaboratively and recognising when your great ideas can help the team achieve objectives, whilst listening to the contributions of others.</p>\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"contentTypeKey\": \"b7fb877c-b810-46b8-9743-ab6c228c03dd\",\n      \"udi\": \"umb://element/85a2c579a286499d902336f24a19c696\",\n      \"image\": \"[\\n  {\\n    \\\"key\\\": \\\"d6d6f7be-d160-43d9-9c50-c320a141e40e\\\",\\n    \\\"mediaKey\\\": \\\"7a99ea81-216e-4b23-8256-1851866a6ef8\\\"\\n  }\\n]\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"contentTypeKey\": \"48cee39d-6ba9-4599-b547-147a9bb31a82\",\n      \"udi\": \"umb://element/45fe015c482f4edcaa7ba228979b049d\",\n      \"textbox\": \"<p><strong>4. Manage your time</strong></p>\\n<p>It may sound cliché, but arriving to work on time, being punctual to meetings, and striving to meet deadlines can do wonders for the impression you make in a work environment.</p>\\n<p>Become a master of time management. </p>\\n<p>There are multiple ways you can achieve this, including learning to prioritise tasks and keeping a schedule close to hand. </p>\\n<p>And if we’ve already tempted you by the idea of up-skilling through a funded course, this doesn’t need to wreak havoc with your carefully organised working day.</p>\\n<p>On fitting training around his work, Kaya says: “It’s all online and we have 3 hours in the evenings Monday to Thursday, so it’s not too intense and the time goes quickly because the training providers keep it really interesting.”</p>\\n<p><strong>5. Seek to solve</strong></p>\\n<p>What’s worse than a problem?</p>\\n<p>Well, a problem that nobody has bothered to find a solution for.</p>\\n<p>Rather than going to your manager with endless problems, think to yourself:</p>\\n<p>•    Can I clearly define the issue?<br>•    Have I triple checked the outcome?<br>•    Can I research a solution?<br>•    How can I develop an action plan?<br>•    What is the impact, and how can this be minimised?</p>\\n<p>To really make yourself a top candidate for that big promotion, try to be the person who actively seeks solutions to problems that will, inevitably, continue to arise.</p>\\n<p>Kaya recognises that, “There is a lot of talk in the VFX industry about whether AI is going to take people’s jobs.”</p>\\n<p>But rather than seeing this as a problem, he’s proactively taken on a course to up-skill and find ways that AI can be beneficial to his own work. </p>\\n<p>Continuing your learning with a funded course can keep you in good practise when it comes to problem solving and seeking a tangible answer. </p>\\n<p><strong>6. Become a leader</strong></p>\\n<p>They say, ‘knowledge is power.’</p>\\n<p>In other words, oftentimes, the best way to become a leader is to know your stuff. </p>\\n<p>Combining all the previous points can prepare you for leading a team and make you a viable candidate for that big promotion – but we must yet again emphasise how continually learning could be your key to clinching it. </p>\\n<p>By taking on a funded course, you can grow your knowledge and be ready to impart this onto a team to really reap the rewards. </p>\\n<p>Thanks to the skills Kaya is acquiring on his course, he now feels that he’s “blazing the trail.”</p>\\n<p>Training to become an expert in your industry and develop other skills will make you a respectable leader – all that’s left to do is nail your interview and the job could be yours.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Get skilled and grab that promotion – <a rel=\\\"noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/what-we-do/employment-and-skills/explore-a-range-of-funded-courses-near-you/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">explore our course finder today.</a> </strong></h4>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"settingsData\": []\n}",
