            <p>Today, the government has announced £18 million of funding for Nottinghamshire County Council to improve the A614, and earmarked funding to set up a locally-led development body for the East Midlands Hub station at Toton, to bring forward investment in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Midlands Connect’s Maria Machancoses has responded to both announcements, made today&nbsp;at the Conservative Party Conference (transcripts can be found here: <a href="http://press.conservatives.com/">http://press.conservatives.com/</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On the announcement from Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, that Nottinghamshire County Council will receive £18 million to improve the A614 at six junctions between Ollerton and Lowdham: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're delighted that Nottinghamshire is to benefit from this first tranche of early funding for the new Major Road Network; this is a shovel ready scheme that will boost the local economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We worked closely with the county council to make sure the government considered this proposal, and our focus now is on ensuring the rest of the Midlands benefits from a long term pipeline of funding that the Major Road Network will provide."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nottinghamshire County Council’s own response can be found here: <a href="http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/newsroom/news/major-18-million-investment-for-a614-set-to-improv">http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/newsroom/news/major-18-million-investment-for-a614-set-to-improv</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On the announcement from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond that there will be funding to support a new, locally-led development body for the area around Toton in the East Midlands: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Together with East Midlands Councils, the Midlands Engine and other partners in the East Midlands, we have been making the case for the last year about the transformational potential of Toton, an opportunity that also includes the ambitious growth plans of East Midlands Airport and the East Midlands Gateway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have been clear that jobs, housing and infrastructure to connect Toton to Nottingham, Derby, Leicester and East Midlands Airport can all be delivered in the 2020s, well before HS2 services arrive. We’re also making the case for opening Toton to HS2 services in 2030, three years earlier than planned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The proposed locally-led delivery body announced today by the Chancellor allows us, alongside our many East Midlands partners, to help shape this amazing opportunity, with the local knowledge so vital for it to succeed. It is also a strong commitment by the government to deliver HS2 for the Midlands and beyond, acknowledging the role the new railway will have in rebalancing the economy.”</p>
