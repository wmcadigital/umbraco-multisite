Here’s some lesser-known yet fascinating facts about magistrates:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>No legal background required</strong><br>Surprisingly, magistrates do not need formal legal training or qualifications. They undergo comprehensive training upon appointment to ensure they're prepared to make fair decisions. In addition, as long as you are over 18, you can become a magistrate.</p>\n<p><strong>Broad jurisdiction and influence</strong><br>Beyond minor offenses, magistrates handle a diverse array of cases, from family disputes to preliminary criminal hearings, demanding versatility and broad legal knowledge. They hear up to 96% of cases that come through the judicial system.</p>\n<p><strong>Voluntary service</strong><br>Many magistrates volunteer their time, showcasing their commitment to public service and community contribution without financial gain. This also rules out the myth that you need to be retired to become one!</p>"

Also, as a magistrate, your own experience and values are welcomed and brought to the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>5️⃣ Essential to Judicial Efficiency<br>Magistrates help streamline the judicial process, tackling less complex cases to alleviate higher court workloads and ensure timely justice.</p>\n<p>Interested in making a difference?
