            <p>The Prime Minister has launched a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-boost-to-rd-and-new-transport-fund-to-help-build-economy-fit-for-the-future">£1.7 billion Transforming Cities Fund</a><span>&nbsp;</span>that will improve transport links and promote local growth within city regions, placing cities at the heart of our industrial strategy.&nbsp; The news was announced today (20 November 2017) and includes £250 million for better transport in the West Midlands.</p>
<p>The Government has said that the Transforming Cities Fund will address weaknesses in city transport systems in order to raise productivity and spread prosperity. It will fund new local transport links, making it easier to travel between often more prosperous city centres and frequently struggling suburbs.</p>
<p>This will help make sure people across the country have better options to combine different modes of transport – supporting projects which will improve connectivity, reduce congestion and introduce new mobility services and technology.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling said:</p>
<p>“Investment in transport is crucial to a strong and resilient economy. The Transforming Cities Fund will drive productivity and growth in cities where this is most needed, connecting communities and making it quicker and easier for people to get around.</p>
<p>“We have already seen the impact of better integrated transport links for both passengers and the local economy in cities like Nottingham and Manchester. This new fund will enable more English cities to reap these benefits, helping to deliver the opportunities and ambition of the Industrial Strategy across the country, as well as driving forward the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine.”</p>
