            <p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has published its <a rel="noopener" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/762190/181205_BEIS_Rail_Sector_Deal_web.pdf" target="_blank" title="Rail Sector Deal">Rail Sector Deal</a></p>
<p>A Midlands Connect spokesperson said:</p>
<p>The Rail Sector Deal rightly recognises the value brought by local solutions to local challenges, a principle at the heart of the Midlands Connect and Midlands Engine strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will continue to work with the UK’s rail experts to ensure our plans future-proof the Midlands’ rail network, are informed by comprehensive data, are appropriately costed, and are deliverable in terms of skills, resource and timescales.</p>
<p>We therefore welcome the deal’s three pilot schemes in the Midlands: a rail data platform to provide a complete picture of the user experience, a programme supporting high potential SMEs in the supply chain, and a skills programme on shared apprenticeships and schools engagement.</p>
<p>We share this deal’s focus on the potential of the railway as a driver of economic growth, and the importance of making the Midlands’ already highly competitive supply chain more focused, efficient and productive through investment in skills and capital.</p>
