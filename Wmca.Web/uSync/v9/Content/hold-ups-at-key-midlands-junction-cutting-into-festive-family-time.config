      "richText": "<div class=\"summary\">\n<p>Drivers travelling home or setting off for a festive getaway on the last Friday before Christmas may face delays over 20 minutes caused by congestion at junction 28 of the M1.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n<p>New analysis from Midlands Connect shows the true agony of driving home for Christmas. The worst period for delays seen in previous years was between 3pm and 4pm, where delays for all routes through the junction added up to 31 minutes. At a usual non-festive peak hour, this setback is an average of eight minutes.</p>\n<p>At this time, vehicles travelling southbound on the M1 faced an average 21 minutes of delay, when earlier in the year the usual hinderance is just 30 seconds. Those turning from the M1 southbound to the A38 westbound faced 15-minute holdups – five times the typical delay.</p>\n<p>Northern parts of the East Midlands region are particularly affected, as the junction serves Alfreton, Bolsover, Ashfield, and Mansfield communities.</p>\n<p>Midlands Connect is recommending the Government considers proposals to improve junction 28 as part of its third Roads Investment Strategy (RIS3). Interventions would reduce congestion and frustration at the roundabout and on the M1, benefitting local drivers as well as those making longer north-south trips.</p>\n<p>Mark Fletcher, MP for Bolsover, commented:</p>\n<p><em>“My constituents are all too familiar with the chore of trying to get home and being stuck at junction 28. During the festive period this can be especially frustrating.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I am joining Midlands Connect in its call for improvements to the junction. The changes can’t come soon enough.”</em></p>\n<p>Swati Mittal, Integrated Transport Programme Lead at Midlands Connect, added:</p>\n<p><em>“The improvements we are recommending for junction 28 are so important. If they are funded as part of RIS3, residents could feel the benefit in Christmases yet to come.”</em></p>\n</div>"
