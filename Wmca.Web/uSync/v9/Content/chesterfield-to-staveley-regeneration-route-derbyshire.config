It will provide an alternative route to the already congested A619, which has varying speed limits (primarily 30 to 40mph).<br><br>The scheme will also include new pedestrian and cycling facilities, whilst also improving bridleways, to encourage active travel for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians.</p>\n<h2>What will the scheme do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduce congestion</strong>: Reducing journey times by providing an alternative to the A619, also providing a diversion route for any incidents and roadwork between M1 Junctions 29 and 30.</li>\n<li><strong>Better public transport</strong>: Improving the frequency and reliability of public transport.</li>\n<li><strong>Encourage active travel</strong>: Providing a safer experience for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians who may have been put off from using the route beforehand.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide new jobs and homes</strong>: Generating 5,700 new jobs and supporting the delivery of 1,800 new homes.</li>\n<li><strong>Essential for HS2</strong>: Linking seamlessly with HS2, providing access to the proposed HS2 Infrastructure Maintenance Depot at Staveley.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Midlands Connect submitted the Chesterfield to Staveley scheme to the Department for Transport for Large Local Major funding. In 2021, the Department for Transport committed £91 million towards the construction of the scheme, subject to the approval of the required business cases. Only when a scheme has its Full Business Case approved, will it be deemed shovel ready and delivery can begin.</p>"
