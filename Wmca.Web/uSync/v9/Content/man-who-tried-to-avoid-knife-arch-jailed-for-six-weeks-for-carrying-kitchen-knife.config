<p>A man has been sentenced to six weeks in prison for possession of a bladed article and drugs after he was caught trying to avoid a police knife crime operation in Walsall train station.</p>
<p>York Wilkinson, of Shaw Court, Brownhills Road in Cannock, was travelling through the station when he noticed the operation being conducted by Safer Travel on Wednesday morning (28 October).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officers spotted Wilkinson back away from the arch and head off in the other direction. He was detained and handed over a kitchen knife and a bag of cannabis.</p>
<p>The weapons and drugs were seized and the 33-year-old was arrested at the scene and remanded in custody overnight until his appearance at Dudley Magistrates Court the following morning.</p>
<p>On Thursday (29 October), Wilkinson was sentenced to six weeks in prison for possession of a bladed article and possession of drugs.</p>
<p>Inspector Rachel Crump, from the Safer Travel police team, said: &ldquo;This is a welcome sentence for a man who was in possession of a dangerous weapon and had made failed efforts to avoid detection by our officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not condone anyone carrying weapons on the railway and we will continue to carry out knife arch operations across stations in the region to keep passengers and staff safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope this sends a clear message to anyone considering carrying a weapon when they’re travelling that they will be caught and prosecuted, and in this case, end up in prison the very next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Safer Travel conduct knife arch operations at transport hubs across the region with support from local policing teams at West Midlands Police and British Transport Police.</p>
