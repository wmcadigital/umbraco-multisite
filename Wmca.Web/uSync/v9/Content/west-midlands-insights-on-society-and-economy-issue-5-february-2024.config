In this issue, we take a deep pe into exports in the West Midlands. The most recent data available for the wider West Midlands region in January 2024 shows that total exports of goods and services have recovered strongly: back to where they were before the pandemic closed the infrastructure of trade.  These are indications that there has been a bounce back for the ever-important automotive industry for the West Midlands.</p>\n<p>But looking at economic data, and comparing change over time, sometimes requires us to stand back a little and take a deeper or wider look.  The huge impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the time lags often involved in collecting economic data make this even more important.</p>\n<p>According to the latest WMREDI report, exports of goods and services from the WMCA fell by one fifth from 2019, when it was the largest exporting region by value, to 2020 and did not recover in 2021.  Other regions saw stronger recoveries in that period.</p>\n<p>Nationally, service exports are predicted to grow from 25% of all trade currently to 28% by 2035.  London’s service exports dwarf all other cities – it exports approximately 15 times more than the second largest service exporting city – but they are also growing from the West Midlands, just not as fast as exports of goods.  Again, this could be seen as an indication of a weak service economy; but look back to the pandemic period and the drop does not seem so severe.  Trade in services was largely able to continue during lockdowns and the impact was much less drastic – a slower recovery is inevitable from a shallower decline.  Considered over a longer period, service exports from the West Midlands look robust and healthy, rather than weak.</p>\n<p>There remains plenty to do to encourage firms in the West Midlands to export, both goods and services.  Global shifts in geopolitics, energy, the movement of people and rapid changes in technology all require careful consideration.  Let's hope that despite the longer-term trends, recent strong export performance in the West Midlands gives them a useful foundation to navigate these headwinds.</p>\n<p><strong>Dan Carins</strong><br>Policy Manager (Business), WMCA</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/documents/research-and-insights/wise-newsletter-february-2024/\">Read the full WISE Issue 5</a>.</p>"
