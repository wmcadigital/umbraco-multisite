<p><span>With Halloween and Bonfire Night looming, bus passengers across the West Midlands are being urged to report anti-social behaviour on the network with the new look See Something Say Something service.</span></p>
<p><span>See Something, Say Something allows people to pass on details of nuisance behaviour tothe Safer Travel Partnership, which operates specifically to tackle and deter crime on the region’s transport network.</span><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>The period leading up to, and immediately after, Halloween and Bonfire Night, along with the school half term, historically sees a rise in anti-social behaviour (ASB).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Inspector Rachel Crump of the&nbsp;Partnership's police team said: "Often it is just a case of high jinks getting out of hand,&nbsp;but left&nbsp;unchecked it can create a real sense of unease that that leads to an unfounded fear of crime on public&nbsp;transport.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"We are not out to spoil anyone's fun but tackling ant-social behaviour on our network is a major target in our aim to make passengers feel safe during their journey.</span></p>
<p><span>"The information we receive from passengers through See Something, Say Something helps us build a bigger picture to identify and deal with problem areas."</span></p>
<p><span>Now in its eighth year the non-emergency service has recently been re-launched and focuses solely on bus travel. The re-launch will see n</span><span>ew posters and information cards being displayed and distributed on the West Midlands bus network over the next few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>All passengers need to do is text &ldquo;Bus&rdquo; followed by a space to 83010, with a message giving as much information as possible about the nature of the incident.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Anyone witnessing criminal behaviour should ring 999 as they would do normally, with a</span><span>dedicated Safer Travel Anti-Social Behaviour Team investigating each report it receives.</span><span>This is then used to build up an intelligence picture that can lead to individuals causing anti-social behaviour on the bus network being identified and facing appropriate action, r</span><span>ail and Midland Metro passengers should use the British Transport Police equivalent, a national text service&nbsp;number of 61016.</span></p>
