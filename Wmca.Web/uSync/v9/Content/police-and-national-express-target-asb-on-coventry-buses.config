<p>National Express Coventry and Safer Travel have been putting joint partnership working into action, patrolling the city’s bus network to keep passengers and staff safe.</p>
<p>In a first for Coventry, Safer Travel’s PC Sean Murphy and Sean Stenson, an Inspector for National Express, teamed up to work together on a number of National Express Coventry routes across the city.</p>
<p>During the first joint partnership working day in Coventry, they successfully:</p>
<ul>
<li>identified a passenger that smokes on service 4 between University Hospital in Walsgrave and the Arena Retail Park</li>
<li>identified another passenger who had consistently avoided paying the correct fare as well as subsequent fines that have been issued</li>
<li>spoke to two youngsters on service 13 that had been swearing in front of other passengers</li>
</ul>
<p>While out on patrol, Inspector Stenson also received a phone call from his National Express Coventry Revenue Inspection colleagues, requesting assistance with a group that had been trying to travel without paying the correct fare.</p>
<p>One woman was found to be using somebody else’s travelcard. PC Murphy was able to educate her on what could happen if she was prosecuted for a fraud offence.</p>
<p>A male in the same group had initially tried to provide a false address when being issued with a fine, however PC Murphy intervened and was able to obtain the correct address.</p>
<p>As part of the Safer Travel Partnership, National Express Coventry and officers from the Safer Travel team are working together to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour on the public transport network.</p>
<p>A recent report showed that in 2017/18, bus crime in Coventry has fallen by 18% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>This is in line with the longer term downward trend, with crime on the wider West Midlands bus network having reduced by approximately 70% in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Tom Stables, managing director of National Express, said: &ldquo;Incidents of serious crime on the bus are few and far between but we know that our customers don't want people smoking, swearing and refusing to pay their fares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first day of joint partnership working in Coventry has produced some good results already, which is great news for our customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re looking at more dates in the near future, including a day working closely with our two new dedicated Revenue Inspectors who recently started supporting our passengers and services across the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Safer Travel Partnership consists on Transport for West Midlands, part of the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA), West Midlands Police, British Transport Police, and transport operators.</p>
<p>Cllr Roger Lawrence, lead member for transport for the WMCA, said: &ldquo;Crime and anti-social behaviour stoke a negative perception of public transport far out of proportion to the reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However where it does occur it needs to be tackled, and I warmly welcome the work of National Express Coventry and West Midlands Police in doing so here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Transport Focus’ bus passenger survey data shows that 80% of passengers said they are satisfied with safety on National Express buses in Coventry. That figure has not dropped below 80% in four years.</p>
<p>Bus passengers can use the Safer Travel Partnership’s See Something, Say Something service to report any anti-social behaviour on National Express Coventry buses.</p>
<p>The reports help to build intelligence data which assists Safer Travel officers with pinpointing any particular hotspots to target.</p>
<p>See Something Say Something provides the travelling public with a discreet way to report nuisance and anti-social behaviour on the bus network.</p>
<p>Passengers can text 'bus' then details of the anti-social behaviour including time, date, location and route number to 83010.</p>
<p>Alternatively passengers can download the free 'See Something, Say Something' phone app, or by report incidents via the new Safer Travel website <a href="http://www.safertravel.info/">www.safertravel.info</a>.</p>
<p>The officers use a variety of tactics, including targeted patrols based on known hot-spots and tip offs from the public; such as 'gateways' (high profile checks of all buses as they pass a particular location) on main roads into city centres, and travelling undercover.</p>
<p>The team also use mobile 4G CCTV cameras and remote monitoring of cameras.</p>                    </div>]]></Value>
