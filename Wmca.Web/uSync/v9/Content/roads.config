      "richText": "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced just how essential our road network is in ensuring the productivity, mobility and safety of our communities. Used by residents, businesses and commuters alike, our road network keeps food on our shelves, provides access to essential services and connects us to our places of work, leisure activities and loved ones.<br>Carefully designed roads maximise the economies of the regions they serve, reducing congestion and improving convenience for users of public transport, pedestrians and cyclists. Midlands Connect is committed to ensuring the most important road projects in our region are developed and delivered as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>The Major Road Network and Large Local Majors</h2>\n<p>The government is investing £3.5 billion in the Major Road Network - a new category of economically important local roads. Midlands Connect was empowered to work with our council partners to produce a priority list of schemes that can be completed by 2025.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/c5e762f3d00748cf9551fa27892bae64}\" title=\"The Major Road Network and Large Local Majors\">Read more about the major road network and large local majors project</a></p>\n<h2>Corridors</h2>\n<p>Midlands Connect is also working to bring forward improvements on three strategic trade and logistics corridors, the A5, A50/500 and A46. Each of these routes serves a local, national and international purpose, linking major businesses to suppliers, customers, ports and airports.<br>Given that these already busy routes are likely to see further population growth due to planned new housing, and given the need to decarbonise our transport network, Midlands Connect is developing holistic improvement plans which will benefit all road users – whether they be logistics operators, commuters, pedestrians, cyclists or public transport users.</p>\n<h3>Key projects</h3>\n<p>Schemes we have assisted with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/816d30b591f44184b0f0fa2bdece54b7}\" title=\"A46 corridor\">A46 corridor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/d9a5318cb2a54d63b4a84c93dbacd170}\" title=\"A50/A500 corridor\">A50/A500 corridor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/77b2b81ee8214711964df605bd8747fb}\" title=\"A5 corridor\">A5 corridor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are working with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Derbyshire County Council</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Lincolnshire County Council</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.stoke.gov.uk/site/\" target=\"_blank\">City of Stoke-on-Trent</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.sandwell.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.leicestershire.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Leicestershire County Council</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Nottinghamshire County Council</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.worcestershire.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Worcestershire County Council</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolverhampton County Council</a></li>\n</ul>"
