            <p>The event will be chaired by Mark Fletcher, MP for Bolsover will bring together local MPs like Ashfield MP Lee Anderson as well as local businesses and councils with the Department for Transport, National Highways and Midlands Connect.</p>
<p>The area is a well-known pinch point and upgrading the junction is a hugely popular idea amongst local residents. Consumer research shows that 82% of respondents supported improvements. More than half of respondents (51%) said the improvements would be ‘very important’ for local businesses.</p>
<p>Delays at junction 28 are costing the economy £4.5 million and MPs are hoping to hear from local firms coming down to Westminster about what impacts its having on them and what potential upgrades could do to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>Local leaders are recommending that these improvements should be considered for funding as part of the Government’s upcoming Road Investment Strategies (RIS), covering the period from 2025 to 2040.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Fletcher, MP for Bolsover, commented:</strong></p>
<p>“It is fantastic that we are able to have this roundtable event today on improving junction 28 of the M1.</p>
<p>“This junction is so important to my constituents. Many people in the area are stuck in delays daily as they travel to work or to appointments. Congestion is causing misery and pollution for the people of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.</p>
<p>“We are calling on the Government to work with Midlands Connect and National Highways to prioritise improvements to this junction, in line with their levelling up targets.”</p>
<p><strong>Maria Machancoses, CEO of Midlands Connect, added:</strong></p>
<p>“Junction 28 is a key interchange in our patch. We are working with local politicians and councils to develop the best strategy for reducing delays in the area.</p>
<p>“It is great to be able to attend this roundtable today and hear from local leaders and businesses on how important this issue is to them and the people they serve."</p>
