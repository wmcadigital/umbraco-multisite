I’m trilingual – I can speak Dutch, Arabic and Sudanese Arabic. Some of my favourite hobbies include playing football (is it bold of me to assume that I think I am the best within the Combined Authority?), camping, and hiking.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I’ve put together a short piece for my colleagues on Ramadan - what it is, a typical day and how to respect people in the workplace who are observing the Holy Month.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><strong>1. What is the Holy Month of Ramadan?</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">The Holy Month of Ramadan is when the Qur’an got revealed to our Prophet Muhammad SAW (Sall’Allahu alayhi wasalam), which translates as “Allah bless him and grant him peace.”</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Fasting for Muslims is instituted as one of the five pillars of Islam, where it is compulsory for Muslims once they have reached a certain age and starts from sunrise until sunset for a period of 30 days. For 2024, Ramadan began on 10 March and will end on April 9.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><strong>2. How and why do you fast during the Holy Month of Ramadan?</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">As Muslims when we fast, food or liquid is not allowed to be swallowed from sunrise until sunset, and when Muslims break their fast, it is broken with Iftar – which is a meal to end the fasting usually eaten together with the family. However, this still does not complete your fast, as a Muslim must still complete their five compulsory daily prayers. Ramadan is a month where Muslims must strive to seek more knowledge about the religion of Islam, ask for forgiveness from Allah S.W.T (Subhanahu wa ta'ala) which translates as, \\\"Glory to Him, the Exalted\\\", offer Zakat (charity), pray more to show gratitude, amongst many more sincere acts.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><strong>3. What does a typical day involve for you during Ramadan?</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">A typical day for me during Ramadan, is starting off the day very early in the morning during a period called Suhoor, where Muslims can eat up until the call of Fajr, the morning prayer which is the first of the day. Following the five compulsory prayers, I try to offer as much prayer as possible and read more of the Qur’an, seek Islamic knowledge, and give charity where I can, and after Iftar I usually attend Taraweeh, which is when we pray in congregation during Ramadan after Isha, the last prayer of the day.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><strong>4. How can non-Muslim colleagues be respectful to Muslims during the Holy Month of Ramadan?</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Ways in which my non-Muslim colleagues can be respectful during the Holy month of Ramadan, is by educating themselves foremost on what it is and why Muslims do it. Ramadan is a month where millions of Muslims around the globe practice one of the five pillars and more, which is Sawm (fasting).</p>\\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">There are many informative resources on the internet where you can find out more about Ramadan – these include <a href=\\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zpdtsbk/articles/zjc2bdm\\\">BBC Bitesize</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.newmuslims.com/category/149/fasting\\\">New Muslims eLearning</a>.</p>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"settingsData\": []\n}",
