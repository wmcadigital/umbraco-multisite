<p style="font-weight: 400;">A woman who racially abused a bus driver in a dispute over a ticket has been ordered to pay him 100 pounds&nbsp;and to pay 200 pounds&nbsp;court costs by magistrates in<span>&nbsp;</span>Birmingham.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Haines, 23, of<span>&nbsp;</span>Braithwaite Road, Sparkbrook was also given a community order for 12 months and must attend a<span>&nbsp;</span>six<span>&nbsp;</span>month alcohol treatment course.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The court heard that on<span>&nbsp;</span>June 03<span>&nbsp;</span>last year Haines was a passenger on a number 8A bus. As she tried to get off in<span>&nbsp;</span>Highgate Road, Sparkbrook,<span>&nbsp;</span>Birmingham, she made a racially offensive remark to driver Sajaad Hussain when he challenged her over her ticket.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After originally failing to attend court she was later arrested by officers and appeared before the court on<span>&nbsp;</span>January 23 this year<span>&nbsp;</span>where she pleaded guilty to the public order offence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">PC Dean Lancaster of the Safer Travel Partnership said: 'We will robustly pursue<span>&nbsp;</span>anyonewho&nbsp;subjects drivers&nbsp;to&nbsp;abuse such as this and if appropriate put them&nbsp;before the courts&nbsp;to ensure justice is done for those working in the public transport industry.'</p>                    </div>]]></Value>
